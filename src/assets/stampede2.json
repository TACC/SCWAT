                    "project_abstract": "The numerical simulations proposed here are aimed at calculating accurate Linear Response Functions (LRFs) of Global Climate Models (GCMs). Calculating accurate LRFs of GCMs has been actively pursued in the past four decades by the climate science community because of the broad applications of such LRFs. However, obtaining accurate LRFs has been found challenging, mainly because turbulence, which plays a key role in the dynamics of atmospheric and oceanic circulations, is poorly understood. The proposed research has two objectives:\n\nObjective 1: To calculate accurate LRFs for several model setups of a widely used atmospheric GCM by employing a method recently developed by the PI. This method will be referred to as the Green's Function (GRF) method. The PI used the GRF method to accurately calculate the LRF of this GCM for one model setup. This accurate LRF has been used to study several problems related to extreme weather events and internal climate variability. Calculating the accurate LRFs for several model setups will allow us to study a wider range of important problems in climate dynamics.\n\nObjective 2: The main drawback of the GRF method is that it is computationally demanding. The second objective is to investigate whether any data-driven method can produce the LRFs with accuracy comparable to that of the GRF method but at a lower computational cost. The performance of several data-driven methods has been found to be poor by various researchers in the past, but the reason(s) behind the poor performance (i.e., low accuracy) is unknown. Another application of the accurate LRFs calculated using the GRF method is that they can be used to identify the source(s) of the poor performance of data-driven methods, as recently demonstrated by PI.",

The more severe drought in the last century in the world, strong coupling between Sahel climate and external forcings, the controversy on the causes of the Sahel climate anomalies, especially the drought, and its significant social and economic implications make this region extremely important for the scientific community.

                    "project_abstract": "Globally, large-scale agriculture and electricity generation require reliable access to water resources, yet it is difficult to predict how changes in one system, such as the impact of climate change on water availability, will impact the others. California presents a case study due to its large agricultural production and its dependence on snowmelt for water resources. In drought years, due to low snow accumulation and the resulting decreased streamflow, groundwater is pumped for irrigation, increasing electricity demand. The observational record suggests that snow accumulation is declining in the Sierra Nevada and that river runoff is peaking earlier in the spring, potentially weeks earlier than the peak in demand for agriculture and human consumption. If snow accumulation declines and precipitation patterns change, both the agricultural and electrical energy sectors of California will need to adapt. Here we examine the hydroclimate component of the agriculture-electricity-water system by estimating how the climate of California may change throughout the twenty-first century. We will perform model simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model where we downscale coarse-resolution global climate model projections from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). By using a regional climate model like WRF, we can simulate hydroclimate conditions at high spatial resolution, which is important for realistic estimates of orographic precipitation, a major driver of snow accumulation in the Sierra Nevada mountains. In order to capture a range of future conditions, we propose to downscale two global climate models and two different emission scenarios. By comparing simulations from the mid-century (2039-2050) and end-of-century (2089-2100) to the historical period (1994-2005), we aim to understand how precipitation and snow accumulation spatiotemporal patterns may change. Though not all snowfall is expected to switch to rainfall by the end of the twenty-first century, a decrease in snowfall percentage is likely to impact both the spatial and temporal patterns of annual precipitation, which will impact timing and magnitude of river runoff. WRF simulations will be shared with project collaborators to estimate how the agriculture and energy sectors may be impacted by projected climate change, linking the hydrology and climate of California to water resource, agriculture, and energy generation models.",

In the case of PT, the interaction of the proton with the biomolecular environment is represented by the multi-state empirical valence bond (MS-EVB) method, and the potential of mean force (PMF) along the pathway of PT is calculated by averaging over highly parallel swarms of trajectories. A novel methodology to simulate multiple protons, based on the MS-EVB, has just been developed by our group and scales nearly linearly with proton number. Large atomistic simulations of biological assemblies will be performed in order to systematically parameterize coarse-grained mesoscopic models that will be employed to examine long time- and length-scale phenomena. Multi-scale coupled simulations of embedded proteins in lipid bilayers, as well as spectrin filaments will be employed to directly examine atomistic-level couplings with mesoscopic phenomena. These studies are extremely challenging and well suited to parallel supercomputing environments.",

Specifically, this project will focus on two thrusts, which are organized by application: (1) methane partial oxidation using cation-exchanged zeolites and (2) regio-selective epoxide ring opening reactions using Lewis-acid zeolites. Using multiscale modeling approaches, these studies will lead to significant advances in understanding (1) formation of active sites under reaction conditions and (2) liquid phase reactions in confined pores. Based on the initial benchmarking results obtained on TACC/Stampede2 system (startup allocation TG-DMR170124), we estimate that ~45k service units (i.e. 44,340 node-hours) on Stampede2 will be necessary.  \nNote: This proposal had been submitted in the previous XRAS cycle. The reviewer comments indicated that additional justification of requested computational resources is necessary. These concerns have been specifically addressed by including a detailed discussion of the computational costs for various calculations to be performed.",

A direct simulation of atomic motion is limited to picoseconds when the forces and energies are based upon density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The relevant timescale for the function of batteries and fuel cells, however, are on a human timescale of second to minutes. In this proposal we will develop the adaptive kinetic Monte Carlo method for use with DFT codes to model novel materials that can function as electrolytes and electrodes in Li batteries and solid oxide fuel cells which can accelerate and select reactions of interest. The parallel resources offered by the XSEDE program will allow us to explore the potential energy surface around stable states and determine the mechanism and rates of possible reaction mechanisms. We have, and will continue over the duration of this project, to develop the EON code which manages the individual calculations that identify saddle points on the potential landscape which correspond to each possible reaction mechanism and collects the information to evolve the system over timescales set by the elementary reaction mechanisms. Importantly, this methodology does not require intuition from the user so that reaction pathways are determined automatically and can be surprising and complex, if that is the nature of the potential energy landscape. We show, in this proposal, that we will be able to efficiently use the XSEDE resources for these calculations. This project will also enable us to accomplish the goals set out in our NSF funded projects to improve the efficiency of our computational methods as well as model intercalation and diffusion in battery materials and the chemistry at catalytic surfaces.",

These new methodologies enable the predictive modeling of reactive multi-phase systems, including free energy landscapes and product yields, where the system interactions are described by Kohn-Sham density functional theory with van der Waals and hybrid functionals. Markov chain Monte Carlo approaches utilizing smart moves with asymmetric underlying matrices, such as the aggregation-volume-bias and configurational-bias Monte Carlo methods, and the Gibbs ensemble framework are employed for efficient exploration of the phase space for reactive single- and multi-phase equilibria in bulk and in confinement. As the reactive and sorption phase equilibria is extremely sensitive to intermolecular potentials, here we evaluate suitability of different density functionals to predict phase equilibria of systems characterized by weak interactions.",

GW170817 was also observed across the electromagnetic\nspectrum by over 70 observatories. These breakthroughs ushered in the era of gravitational wave and multimessenger astronomy, allowing us to probe gravity and matter in unprecedented regimes. Robust, first-principles theoretical modeling of multimessenger sources is necessary both to build templates for detecting gravitational wave signals in upcoming observations, and for the interpretation of existing and future multimessenger signals. Such modeling requires supercomputer simulations of gravitational wave sources by solving the Einstein equations coupled to matter, electromagnetic fields and radiation. Several groups are performing such simulations focusing on subsets of the vast parameter space of compact binaries that must be explored to achieve complete understanding of the problem; our group has substantial expertise studying compact binary mergers, circumbinary accretion onto binary black holes, and the nuclear equation of state. The simulations proposed here will advance the state-of-the-art on all these fronts. In particular, we propose to perform the first systematic studies of the effects of realistic, finite temperature component of the nuclear equation of state in binary neutron star mergers, and the impact of black hole spin in magnetized accretion disks onto binary black holes.",

While analytic methods such as the post-Newtonian approximation and effective one-body (EOB) formalism can be used to predict wave forms for most of the inspiral, wave forms from the final few orbits, plunge, and merger can be predicted only by large-scale numerical computations. The EOB formalism can be used to construct templates for gravitational wave data analysis by adding parameters that can be calibrated with numerical simulations.  These calibrations, however, require very accurate numerical simulations.  We propose to do a series of simulations and calibrate the EOB waveforms with the results of our simulations for binary systems with non-equal black hole masses as well as arbitrary black hole spins. Neutron stars merging with stellar mass black holes are potentially sources of short duration gamma-ray bursts, depending upon how much of an accretion disk is formed during the merger.  We plan to explore the dependence of the disk formation on the mass ratio, spin of the black hole, and the currently unknown equation of state describing the neutron star.",

There are two avenues of science that\nwill be investigated in this proposal, each spearheaded by a senior postdoctoral researcher or\nsenior research programmer in the Gravity Group at the National Center for Supercomputing\nApplications (NCSA), University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). NCSA is a mem-\nber of the LIGO Scientific Consortium (LSC), all co-PIs are LIGO members, and the XSEDE\nallocation will primarily support research which is part of the NCSA LIGO activities.\n We will study the reliability of physical predictions for binary neutron star (BNS) merger\nwaveforms by current numerical codes. BNS mergers are one of the prime targets for\ngravitational waves (GWs) detectable by aLIGO, yet there is no work that tries to validate\nthe predicted GWs between different numerical codes. Such a comparison, performed in\nthe numerical relativity and analytical relativity (NRAR) project for binaries black holes\n(BBHs), will improve the confidence in the predictions of these numerical simulations,\nand their use in model construction for aLIGO.\n As part of our LIGO reviewed contribution to LIGO science goals, we will construct\na model for GWs emitted by the mergers of spinning BBHs on eccentric orbits. One\nof the most exciting prospects in the next aLIGOs observing runs is the detection of\neccentric GW signals, since these events will provide unique insights about the binary\nassembly process. Even if no detection of eccentric binaries is obtained, the use of\neccentric waveform templates is of critical importance to exclude a significant dynamically\nassembled population of compact binaries that merge in dense stellar environments.\nCo-PIs of this proposal are leading the development of eccentric waveform models in the\nLIGO Scientific Collaboration to realize this science. Recent research highlights include\nthe development of the first time domain waveform model that describes the inspiral,\nmerger and ringdown of compact binary systems whose components are non-spinning,\nand which evolve on orbits with low to moderate eccentricity. Using this model, we\ncarried out the first comprehensive analysis on the effect of eccentricity in the detection\nof the GW transients GW150914 and GW151226. This allocation will enable us\nto develop from the ground up state-of-the-art waveform models that describe the merger\nof spinning BHs on eccentric orbits. As we have done in the past, we will implement these\nnew models in LIGOs Algorithm Library (LAL) for their use in actual GW searches.\nOur research group consists of 1 faculty member, 4 senior postdoctoral research scholars, 1\nsenior research programmer, 1 graduate student and 2 undergraduate students.

Several active transporters that use various source of energy in a living cell for their function will be investigated. Furthermore, we will also continue our research on another membrane associated phenomenon, namely mechanism of membrane binding and activation of blood coagulation factors, which constitutes the most productive project over the past funding period, and a strong collaborative effort between 5 labs at UIUC.  In fact, all of the projects are conducted in close collaboration with leading experimental groups.   All Projects address rather slow processes, thus, requiring long simulations. Furthermore, due to the need of explicit representation of the lipid and water, which play role in the mechanism of transporters, and due to the complexity of the structure, large molecular assemblies need to be simulated. Such calculations can only be carried out with the advanced TeraGrid computational resources. The size and\ncomplexity of the function of these proteins pose a great challenge for computational studies. Over the last funding period, however, we have demonstrated through several published papers reported in the Progress Report, that large scale MD simulations can indeed significantly advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of energy coupling and transport phenomena in these biomolecules. Due to limited space and the need to describe 6 projects, we have delegated the progress and discussion of our preliminary results\ncompletely to the Progress Report. Our extensive use of the allocation over the past funding period is the strongest evidence for the computational demands of such biomolecular systems. We note, however, that we have used the allocated time extremely productively and produced a record number of publications (16; please see Progress Report) over the past funding cycle. We would like to give a general clarification with regard to the length of the proposed simulations, which might be perceived as an \"unjustified\" aspect. All of the projects address rather slow biomolecular processes (at least on the\norder of microsecond). As such, even orders of magnitude longer simulations than those described in this application\ncan be easily justified from a technical point of view. However, we realize that such processes (e.g., complete transport cycle) cannot be currently described in their entirety, and we can only expect to cover some of the steps involved in such processes. Therefore, in order to provide a justification that will hopefully\nbe satisfactory, almost in all cases we will base the length of the proposed simulations on our existing benchmarks (mostly published) of the same or comparable systems/phenomena. \n\n",

Vibrational probe groups in proteins provide data in which the structural ensemble is in slow exchange and directly appears in the lineshape, unlike most other protein analytical techniques.  We have recently cemented an approach that can provide quantitatively interpretability from vibrational probe lineshapes and directly link those lineshapes to physical and structural changes in the protein.  This computational allocation will be used to predict structural ensembles (through replica exchange simulations), to run short trajectories on submembers of those ensembles with the probe groups included, and to calculate the vibrational frequencies throughout the MD trajectories to provide lineshapes which could connect our extensive experimental data to dynamic structural ensembles. Constituting such a connection would be highly significant for many different proteins; this allocation will focus on three proteins: calmodulin (our test system), viral replicative complexes from the Hendra and Nipah viruses, and acyl carrier proteins.",

They are ligand gated ion channels with membrane lipids being their primary regulators.

Kir channels should adopt several different functional states depending on differential regulatory lipid binding as well as pore blocker binding. Although a few Kir channel crystal structures have been determined4-9, the three-dimensional structures in each functional state are yet to be elucidated and dynamic properties of the channels is almost absent, which limits our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of channel function and hence the opportunities to develop small molecules to access specific states. We aim to fill up these holes in our knowledge of Kir channel gating through combining experimental approaches (x-ray crystallography, single particle-EM, single molecule FRET, in vitro functional assays, and electrophysiology) and computational modeling (docking and molecular dynamics simulations), which will advance our knowledge of how these channels undergo various conformations as well as dynamic states throughout their functional cycles.",

It is well known that certain geometrical modifications to aircraft engines can reduce their radiated noise.  However, there is no manner to predict which modifications will actually reduce the noise, resulting in lengthy---and costly---experimental programs to parametrically study candidate design modifications.  This deficiency is due to the conceptual, experimental, and computational challenges associated with turbulence-generated sound and, hence, in developing effective control methods.  By solving the compressible Navier-Stokes equations directly, this research provides foundational descriptions of the sound-generating fluid motions and subsequent development of optimized control methodologies.  The PI's code is based on advanced finite difference techniques and scales at 90\\% of perfect up to 1024 processors on TACC's Ranger.  This work follows up the previous DACs TG-CTS080019 (DJB) and TG-CTS080030N (JBF).

The thesis of the current research is that transformative ideas in modeling, computation and analysis of cardiac blood flows and associated heart sound can enable highly effective and inexpensive simulation-guided therapies and diagnostic tools for heart diseases in the not-too-distant future. Understanding cardiac flows, especially inside the left ventricle, is an essential first step to diagnosing and treating several heart related diseases. Numerous efforts have been made in analyzing cardiac flows over the past two decades through in-vitro (e.g., laboratory PIV measurements), in-vivo (e.g., phase contrast MRI) experiments and computational methods. Though medical imaging techniques such as phase contrast MRI, CT, etc., provide details about the anatomy and some gross features of the flow, not much insight related to complex fluid behavior can be obtained using these approaches. Most of the computational and laboratory (in-vitro) studies have employed simplified geometries while attempting to match physiological values in terms of key hemodynamic parameters, and ignored pivotal interactions between heart flexible tissues, especially heart valves, and complex flow patterns inside heart chambers. The long-term goal of the current project is to develop image-based, biophysically-detailed, multi-scale, multi-physics models of the ventricular blood flows in health and disease that run efficiently on large-scale, CPU/GPU clusters, and to use these models to understand the biophysics of cardiac dysfunction. In this year, we will i) validate the computational modeling of cardiac flow against the in-vivo MRI measurements, ii) investigate the effect of structural dynamics of heart valve and its interaction with hemodynamics, and iii) biochemical process on the development of heart diseases.",

The studies planned for the upcoming year will focus on development of practical skin-friction drag reduction technologies for transportation inspired by the mechanisms observed in polymer drag reduction. A cornerstone of these studies is some recent preliminary DNS studies performed in our lab which show that in turbulent channel flow, MDR conditions can be achieved with the polymer force activated only in the viscous sub-layer and the buffer layer. This observation opens up new possibilities for developing practical drag reduction technologies for use in transportation. The simulations planned for the upcoming year will include: (i) more detailed simulations of turbulent channel flow with the polymer force activated only in the viscous sub-layer and the buffer layer; (ii) simulations of turbulent channel flow with a sharp viscosity gradient imposed in the viscous sub-layer and the buffer layer; (iii) simulations of turbulent channel flow with a wire mesh in the viscous sub-layer and the buffer layer; and (iv) simulations of turbulent channel flow with flexible fibers in the viscous sub-layer and the buffer layer. The principle action of all these drag reduction technologies is to redirect a small portion of turbulence kinetic energy at the location of the peak of turbulence production in the buffer layer into a path other than the normal turbulent energy cascade. This re-routing of the turbulence kinetic energy at a given turbulent scale results in a drop in the fluctuating strain rate at that scale which, in turn, inhibits the ability of turbulence to redistribute the kinetic energy at that scale from the streamwise to the cross-stream directions through the pressure-strain term.  This results in a pileup of kinetic energy in the streamwise direction and a drop of kinetic energy in the cross-stream directions, which leads to an overall drop in the Reynolds shear-stress and a concomitant drop turbulence production, thus leading to turbulence suppression and drag reduction. These are the principle mechanisms at work in drag reduction by dilute polymer solutions. A total of 400,000 SUs is requested for these studies. Because the IU BigRed will be decommissioned from Teragrid service in March 2010, the requested allocation is split between IU, which we plan to use up to March 2010, and TACC Ranger which we plan to use thereafter. The requested tape storage at SDSC HPSS is for existing data which we have stored at this facility over the past seven years.\n",

This so-called airblast atomization process has been shown to be an effective way to produce fine sprays compared to other fuel injectors. The characteristics of the sprays generated by fuel injectors have a direct impact on the mixing between fuel and oxidizer and the subsequent combustion.

The availability of high-fidelity LES data has the potential to significantly increase the impact of this study, since the data will support a detailed investigation and validation of the methodology. The LES simulation results will demonstrate whether the turbulence model form uncertainty quantification method does effectively provide realistic bounds for the prediction of the flow field, and will also be used to guide further development of the method. \nThe LES simulations with heat transfer will consider realistic heat exchanger geometries to obtain a high-fidelity data base of the Reynolds stresses and the turbulent heat fluxes. This database will be used to establish and validate a novel methodology to quantify uncertainty in turbulent heat flux models. The results will be analyzed to address two main questions, similar to those previously considered for development of the Reynolds stress model uncertainty quantification method: 1) define a marker that indicates in which regions of the flow the turbulent heat flux model plausibly fails and 2) define perturbations of the turbulent heat fluxes that result in the prediction of realistic upper and lower uncertainty bounds for the temperature field.",

Sensitivity studies will be carried out in which the boundary conditions (river flow, sediment inputs, vegetation cover, etc.) are varied and the students will model the evolution of the estuarine and coastal characteristics. This process-based modeling approach will allow students to develop a robust understanding of these dynamic and important environments.

Specifically, we will use the model output identify the relative roles of tides and eddies in transporting water masses across the continental slope, in moving water masses around the continental shelf, and in mixing and entrainment between these water masses.",

However, still some types of ions can permeate directly from that depending on the type and composition of the membrane.\nThe mechanism of this passive permeation of ions is still under debate and some aspects of it is unknown. For positively charged ions, like potassium, the interaction with the charged phosphate head groups plays an important role in the permeation. Computer simulation are one of the powerful tools to shed light on this phenomenon.\n\nIn this project, a new set of reaction coordinates will be introduced to consider the interaction of the potassium ion with phosphate groups. The complete pathway of the permeation will be found in the space of these new reaction coordinates by means of a well-known method called Milestoning in which the thermodynamics and kinetics of this permeation will be obtained. The results will be compared to the available experimental data. \n\nThis start up project will be done on potassium. This allocation will be helpful to understand and test these set of reaction coordinate for a research plan for different types of ions with different charges and sizes which we expect to submit later as a research allocation project.\n\nFor this study NAMD software will be used which is available on Lonestar 5.\n\nWe need to cover a region of 35*35 Angstroms with resolution of 1 Angstrom to find the thermodynamics and kinetics of this permeation. To achieve our goal we need to set up 35*35=1225 short simulations of 0.5 nanosecond each. This is equivalent to ~0.6 microseconds in total. The benchmarks obtained for a similar system to be approximately 14-15ns/day  on Lonestar 5 if we use 2 node/day (48SU). So the whole project can be performed with a 2100SU startup project on Lonestar5.\n\nAll the analysis will be performed on the local computers after moving the files.\nThe result is expected to be published in a peer reviewed journal.",

In this proposal, we request for TeraGrid computational facilities to approach cellular mechanotransduction from a computational viewpoint and shed light on two important sub-cellular phenomena in which the role of mechanical factors are decisive: focal adhesion formation and nucleocytoplasmic transport. Individual molecules are suggested to be molecular mechanosensors at focal adhesions. These molecules alter their binding activity upon exposure to external force. We will investigate the validity of this suggestion and evaluate the mechanisms by which single molecules at focal adhesions could act as molecular mechanosensors. \nWhile our main focus in this proposal will be investigation of focal adhesion formation, we also aim to shed light on nucleocytoplasmic transport across the nuclear pore complex (NPC) using two different approaches: (1) all atomic simulations and (2) coarse-grained modeling. It is suggested that NPC tpr proteins interact with transport factors crm1 and importin-&#946;/&#945; to facilitate the cargo-complex translocation across the NPC. The alleged hydrophobic binding sites, however, are not determined yet. We suggest a thorough molecular dynamic simulation to find those sites. Results from this project could reveal possible mechanisms for facilitated transport. Taking into account the results of all-atomic simulations, we also will develop a coarse-grained model of the whole structure of the NPC to provide a big picture of nucleocytoplasmic transport and find out the specific role of some important factors in active transport, such as FG-repeat density in the pore, active cargo-FG hydrophobic binding affinity, aspect ratio of active cargo, and existing of competing factors within the pore for FG-repeat binding sites. The 9,900,000 SUs we are requesting will let us proceed with these projects and reveal important aspects of each of them at different scales. \n",

The research we plan to perform, which is funded by NIH grant GM30580 to RML, addresses forefront biophysical issues concerning basic mechanisms of molecular recognition in biological systems. The software infrastructure we propose to employ is optimized through parallelism at various levels of the calculation and can make efficient use of the hardware configuration of the AQSL Teragrid clusters. This request follows a start-up allocation of 50,000 SU's (no. MCB100089) which allowed us to port the necessary code and perform benchmarking tests.",

Even though the blooms are non-toxic, they have a significant impact on the levels of nutrients, light and oxygen in the estuary. Mesodinium displays very particular physiology that makes it one of few planktonic species able to thrive in a highly flushed system: a high growth rate due to its ability to photosynthesize using the photosynthetic organelles of its preys, and complex migrating patterns. With this proposal we will improve an existing Mesodinium model and study the sensitivity of the initiation and decay of the bloom to the river flow magnitude, the timing of the seasonal river flow reduction and the atmospheric forcing. We will also couple the Mesodinium model to a biogeochemical model of the estuary to improve our understanding of the effects that Mesodinium blooms have on the oxygen levels and the production  respiration balance of the estuary. In order to correctly capture the remineralisation processes linked to the Mesodinium bloom decay, a benthic module will be added to the estuary biogeochemical model. We request 754K SU in TACC Stampede and 16 TB of storage in TACC Ranch. ",

Because cell-to-cell inheritance is crucial to the function of epigenetic marks, understanding their biology requires an intimate knowledge of DNA replication as well as tools to study events occurring in S phase. In the proposed project, the tools and knowledge of DNA replication developed in the previous PGRP project will be used to characterize epigenome dynamics during S phase in two important model systems \u2013 maize and Arabidopsis.\nA combination of flow cytometry and in vivo labeling will be used to dissect multiple stages within S phase of cells in suspension culture and in planta.

These alterations are often non-random and tend to occur at preferred genomic locations or within certain DNA sequence contexts. We postulate that both the primary DNA sequence as well as secondary structures formed by repeating DNA motifs account in part for the observed sequence-dependent mutation bias. We wish to collect all cancer genome mutation data with the purpose of identifying sequence dependent patterns of mutation by applying bioinformatics and molecular modeling approaches.\n\nSpecific aim 1. To test whether sequences prone to form non-B DNA conformations promote chromosomal breaks that lead to gross rearrangements in cancer.\n\nWe wish to address the question as to whether DNA sequences with the potential to form alternative (non-B) DNA structures promote chromosomal breaks that lead to gross rearrangements (deletions, duplications, inversions). Towards this end, we have developed comprehensive bioinformatic search criteria to identify all putative non-B DNA-forming sequences, including inverted repeats (cruciform structures), direct repeats (slipped structures), purine.pyrimidine tracts (triplex DNA), alternating purine-pyrimidine runs (left-handed Z-DNA), G-quartets (quadruplex DNA) and phased A-tracts (bent DNA), which have been annotated both in the human genome as well as in some other mammalian genomes. By mapping the locations of chromosomal breaks in cancers with the reference human genome we expect to capture on a broad scale the genomic context of gross rearrangements with respect to the potential of the DNA double helix to adopt more complex secondary structures.\n\nSpecific aim 2. To test whether differences in electron distribution along the primary DNA sequence are responsible for sequence preferences in single-base substitutions in cancer.\n\nWe wish to address whether sequence-dependent differences within the primary DNA sequence are responsible for variations in single-base substitution patterns among different tumor types. To this end, we are applying high-level theory quantum mechanical calculations to model electron distribution patterns and ionization potentials for all possible tri- and tetra-nucleotide sequence combinations. We then apply these results to single-base substitutions patterns in various cancer types. Our preliminary data on publicly available databases support our postulate that there exists a correlation between predicted sequence-dependent ionization potentials and the fraction of mutated sequences in certain tumor types, such as the lung and melanomas.\n\nSpecific aim 3. To test whether cancer mutations that disrupt putative non-B DNA conformations also disrupt the regulatory functions these sequence elements may play.\n\nMost DNA regulatory elements are outside protein-coding sequences. We speculate that a number of cancer mutations may disrupt critical regulatory interactions, either by abolishing binding sites for binding factors or by weakening the stability of secondary structures employed by the cell to perform biological function. We wish to annotate all cancer genome mutations within putative gene regulatory regions and assess their potential to disrupt regulatory protein binding sites and potential non-B DNA conformations. To this end, we are modeling the stability and structures of various DNA conformations by applying molecular dynamics simulations.",

Understanding how polyploid and hybrid crops grow better than the parents will generate a direct impact in agriculture, the environment, food security, renewable energy, and human health.  Most important crops including wheat and cotton are allopolyploid, and many others such as maize (an ancient polyploid) are grown as hybrids.  Hybrids are formed by mating with different strains, varieties or species. An allopolyploid such as wheat or African clawed frog is formed by hybridizing with two or more species followed by chromosome doubling, whereas an autopolyploid such as potato or salmon results from genome duplication within the same species.  Many organisms that behave as diploid are actually paleopolyploid (ancient polyploid) and overtime become diploidized, as shown in the sequenced genomes of yeast, Arabidopsis poplar tree, grapevine, maize, and soybean.  Of flowering plants, over 70% may be recent polyploids of which >75% are allopolyploids. In this project, we will use genomic and computational tools to elucidate changes in gene expression in Arabidopsis allopolyploids and hybrids, maize and sorghum hybrids, as well as to annotate and compare the genomes of cultivated allotetraploid cotton and its extant diploid progenitors.",

Our recent results indicate that we can potentially solve that puzzle in a region of parameter space which allows for the re-formation of the cold gas faster than its destruction through hydrodynamical instabilities. However, thus far we could merely show that this parameter space exists. In the proposed research, we want to bridge the gap to observations, and extend our work to realistic setups which include a non-homogeneous wind model, magnetic fields, and anisotropic thermal conduction. Each of these processes are present in galactic environments and will influence the outcome substantially, and are thus crucial to include in order to assess if this effect can indeed solve the \"entrainment problem\", and to compare our findings to observations.",

In our new physical model, the ISM is explicitly resolved into dense molecular clouds. Star formation is confined to these high-density regions and, as it proceeds, injects large quantities of energy and momentum into the surrounding medium via stellar feedback. This stellar feedback is critical to produce realistic galaxies and to generate powerful galactic winds. These galactic winds also have important effects on the circum-galactic and intergalactic media (CGM, IGM), and understanding them is a key frontier.\nFor the first time, we incorporate all the important stellar feedback mechanisms (radiation pressure in the ultra-violet, optical, and infrared; stellar winds; supernova explosions of Types I & II; and photoionization heating in HII regions) in a self-consistent manner. The combination of resolved, clumpy ISM and positive reinforcement of different feedback mechanisms produce powerful galactic winds with properties consistent with observations without ad hoc prescriptions, which previous simulations typically have had to incorporate.\nFor this initial study, our proposed simulations concentrate on the high-redshift Universe. This regime, of intense observational focus, is less computational expensive and will therefore allow us to simulate a range of galaxies (from dwarfs to massive disks) to develop a systematic understanding of the scale-dependent physics.\nThanks to their novelty and realism, the proposed set of simulations will be analyzed to address a wide array of timely scientific questions. We will study the evolution of the galactic ISM, galaxy growth and its self-regulation via galactic winds, the interaction of infalling material with galactic outflows, metal dispersion in the CGM and IGM, as well as the thermal, kinematic, and ionizing effects of galaxies on their surroundings. XSEDE resources provide the computational power necessary to perform our simulations, which have outgrown our local computing resources. We will use the well-tested smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code Gadget-3, which we significantly expanded to implement more realistic cooling, star formation, and feedback modules (also verified in a series of recent papers describing them).\nWe have successfully performed multiple medium-sized runs using the production version of the code on a university-based computing cluster and have successfully compiled and run basic scaling tests with the same version of the code on Ranger at TACC. This enabled us to estimate runtime requirements for our proposed simulations, totaling 1.76 million SUs.",

This dark matter is generally assumed to be \"cold\" in the sense that it has negligible thermal velocity in the early Universe; this assumption is supported by virtually all observations of dark matter. At the smallest scales we can probe observationally, however, discrepancies have emerged. These scales are tested by the abundance and structure of dwarf galaxies, and many observations indicate less structure than would naively be expected in cold dark matter models. This may be an indication of a small but non-zero free-streaming length for dark matter.\n\nWe propose to run a suite of simulations of dwarf galaxies under the assumption that dark matter is \"warm\". The simulations will include two versions: dark-matter-only simulations, where the structure of the dwarf galaxy hosts will only be set by dark matter physics, and full simulations with galaxy formation physics, which can also modify the dark matter structure. Our adopted galaxy formation physics models are state-of-the-art and being used in multiple related projects, providing strong legacy value for these simulations. Additionally, we have already performed identical simulations of the very same dwarf galaxies in the Cold Dark Matter model, meaning we will be able to directly compare our results to existing simulations in the standard cosmology.

Our work will contribute to our understanding on how baryons transform the central structure of dark matter halos, how self-interacting dark matter affects galaxy formation, and what are the resulting central densities of dark matter halos when self-interacting dark matter acts together with baryonic processes.

Instead, astronomers observe these galaxies using radio telescopes such as the Very Large Array in New Mexico and the ALMA telescope in Chile. My work utilizes natural \"cosmic microscopes\" - taking advantage of intervening foreground galaxies between us and the more distant dusty galaxies, which magnify our view of the background galaxies in a process called gravitational lensing. In order to understand the intrinsic properties of the background galaxies, though, we must model the effects of this lensing. This is computationally difficult for data from the telescopes listed above, because they measure the Fourier transform of the sky instead of a direct image of it, and each observational dataset contains millions of observables. I have written advanced codes to do this modeling.  For the startup portion of this project over the past months, I got the codes to run on TACC's stampede2 system and ran some test analyses. I am now ready to continue this work under a standard research allocation.",

                    "project_abstract": "While neutrino oscillation experiments have demonstrated that neutrinos have small, nonzero masses, resulting in the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physics, much remains unknown about their properties and decay modes. One potential decay mode \u00e2?? neutrinoless double beta decay (0\u00ce\u00bd\u00ce\u00b2\u00ce\u00b2) \u00e2?? is a particularly interesting target of current experimental searches, since its observation would imply that the neutrino is a Majorana particle, demonstrate that lepton number conservation is violated in nature and thus provide a possible mechanism for baryogenesis in the early universe, and give further constraints on the neutrino masses and mixing angles. Relating experimental constraints on 0\u00ce\u00bd\u00ce\u00b2\u00ce\u00b2 decay rates to the neutrino masses, however, requires theoretical input in the form of nuclear matrix elements which remain difficult to calculate reliably. Current nuclear model calculations of the needed matrix elements for a particular nuclei typically differ by 100% or more [1], and continued progress toward using experimental measurements to constrain particular models of neutrinoless double beta decay will require improving this situation.\n\nIn principle, lattice QCD allows for entirely ab-initio calculations of the relevant nuclear matrix elements with complete control over systematic errors. First results for the long-distance contributions to the neutrinoful double beta decay process nn \u00e2?? ppee\u00ce\u00bd\u00ce\u00bd and the leading order short-distance contributions to 0\u00ce\u00bd\u00ce\u00b2\u00ce\u00b2 in chiral perturbation theory have been recently computed in Refs. [2] and [3] by the NPLQCD and CalLat collaborations, respectively. NPLQCD has since developed code based on the Columbia Physics System (CPS) [4] and Bagel Fermion Sparse Matrix Library (BFM) [5] code bases for computing 0\u00ce\u00bd\u00ce\u00b2\u00ce\u00b2 decay matrix elements, and has performed an initial exploratory calculation of the simplest such process \u00cf? \u00e2?? \u00cf?ee described in Ref. [6]. We are currently running a complete calculation of the long-distance and short-distance contributions to the 0\u00ce\u00bd\u00ce\u00b2\u00ce\u00b2 decay amplitude for \u00cf? \u00e2?? \u00cf?ee on the locally available Blue Gene/Q supercomputer at Brookhaven National Lab, which will be permanently decommissioned in January.\n\nAn XSEDE startup allocation will allow us to port this code to the Intel Knights Landing platform and profile its performance. Existing high-performance KNL code implemented in the Grid physics library [7] can be used in place of our existing BFM code optimized for the BG/Q\nplatform, and we will also explore replacing our current FFT routines which use the FFTW MPI library with the optimized Intel Math Kernel Library FFT routines. We will then use Stampede to finish our \u00cf? \u00e2?? \u00cf?ee calculation if needed, and begin to explore computing matrix elements of processes with baryonic and nuclear initial and final states --- such as the fundamental, quark-level decay nn \u00e2?? ppee which occurs inside the nucleus --- which can then be related to matrix elements of large nuclei used in 0\u00ce\u00bd\u00ce\u00b2\u00ce\u00b2 experiments through many-body effective field theory techniques. These are challenging but important calculations that will require large-scale resources like those available through XSEDE, and we intend to use the Startup Allocation to prepare a request for a Research Allocation in the next cycle.\n\nReferences:\n[1] A.

We are testing the hypothesis that the convergent evolution of monogamy across wide evolutionary distances involves the recruitment of similar gene modules. We have sequenced the brain transcriptomes of male individuals from sister species pairs (of which one if monogamous and one is polygamous) of songbirds, Microtus voles, Ectodini cichlids, new world primates,  and paired and non-paired burying beetles, using SOLiD RNA-sequencing.  We expect to find several gene modules that are commonly regulated in monogamous males, such as neuroendocrine genes and transcription factors, as well as a different set of gene modules that are similarly regulated in polygamous mating systems. We are also sequencing promoter regions using RNAPol II ChIP-sequencing to investigate to what extent these patterns of gene regulation impinge on similar promoter motifs in the genome.",

                    "project_abstract": "Many natural and artificial processes involve the simultaneous flow of two or three fluid phases (such as water, oil, and air) through porous media. However, the prediction of how fast the phases move through and whether they can be retrieved at all is not trivial. It requires knowledge of the topology of different fluids in a complex three-dimensional space that ranges from simple soil to root-soil systems, and from a uniform sandstone to fractured carbonate rocks. Both porous media (soil or rock) and fluid properties (i.e. which fluid is preferentially wetting the rock surface) determine the final spatial distribution when multiple fluids are competing within pores. Furthermore, minuscule rock or soil pores often control which fluids become trapped and where. Quantifying the spatial arrangement of fluids in pores of complex geometry and varying wettability remains an outstanding, fundamental problem. Furthermore, the generalization (upscaling) of such arrangements to larger spatial regions of interest has not been addressed before. The objective of the project is to explore and quantify dynamic spatial fluid arrangements from first principles, regardless of the inherent complexity of porous media. To address the objective, the project will develop a flexible, multiscale numerical method to accurately describe two- and three-fluid phase flow configurations in porous materials of heterogeneous wettability. Through collaborations, detailed 3D experimental data imaged with x-ray microtomography of two and three-phase flow configurations will be available for both input and verification of the numerical method. Results will enable the quantification and upscaling of rock surfaces of different wettability and roughness of porous media on the ultimate arrangement of fluids, and will correlate measured properties with the position and interconnectivity of heterogeneities in larger spatial regions of interest.\n\nFinally, one part of the above proposal, recently funded by NSF Directorate of Earth Sciences is setting up a repository of imaged porous samples (rocks, soil and artificial porous media) using X-ray microtomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Images are typically of large size, easily in the range 8-64GB each, and thus there is widely available repository thus far.",

Molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory (DFT) will be employed to directly examine physical atomic behaviors to enhance fundamental knowledge of transport phenomena. The proposed research includes (1) mass diffusion in joining of metallic nanostructures (Cu-Ni-Ag), (2) water behaviors (phase change, viscosity, and convective heat transfer) in nanochannels, (3) mass and thermal transport characteristics of aluminum alloys, (4) thermal transport control of novel two-dimensional materials, and (5) diffusion and oxidation in a chromia-containing scale. From utilization of MD simulations, we will analyze atomic structure evolution, displacement speed, thermal vibration, and potential energy of constituent atoms to ultimately assess various transport properties (mass: self-diffusivity and activation energy, momentum: viscosity, thermal: conductivity and heat transfer coefficient). Moreover, in the determination of thermal transport in metallic materials, electron-phonon coupling from DFT calculations will also be considered within Boltzmann transport equations for more effective rendering of accurate results. Based on preliminary simulations using XSEDE startup allocations, we estimate a total of 2,200,000 core-hours on Stampede, Bridges, and Comet will be required for this proposed research.",

We will also study the factors that limit the electronic performance of 2D semiconductors, and use these insights to computationally search for better 2D semiconductors.

However, the composition space of MPEAs is large and unsuitable for classical materials science experimentation techniques, creating a need for computational methodologies for alloy discovery and development.  The work proposed herein seeks to develop an efficient computational technique to calculate the stacking fault energy of a given MPEA materials system and demonstrate the usefulness of such a database of properties for future ally down-selection and development.  This proposal requests 35,200 node hours on Stampede 2 in order to accomplish this project.

                    "project_abstract": "Secondary energy storage technologies based on sodium ions are an important emerging alternative to lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Sodium is less expensive than lithium, with its supplies being much wider and more democratically distributed throughout the globe. Therefore, there is the potential for significantly reduced system cost, as well as for increased energy security due to ease of obtaining sodium precursors as compared to lithium carbonate. Hybrid sodium ion capacitors (NICs) and dedicated high power sodium ion batteries (NIBs) are energy storage devices that are meant to bridge the power \u00e2?? cyclability \u00e2?? energy density gap of conventional secondary batteries and supercapacitors. Due to their electrode architecture these devices may operate at rates near or even above 60C (1C being one hour charge), i.e., single minute charge or discharge. Their enhanced energy as compared to supercapacitors is due to the electrodes that offer the potential for bulk Na storage, as well as due to the Na ion electrolyte that operates at higher voltages as compared to acetonitrile, etc. \n\nA survey of literature indicates that the most optimum negative (anode) electrodes for NICs consist of high surface area two-dimensional (2-D) carbons, such as various high surface area carbon nanosheets reported in literature. To date the intermediate and fast Na charge storage mechanisms in such carbons are poorly understood. The perception is that at rates such as 5C, 10C or even 60C, it is effectively \u00e2??business-as-usual\u00e2?\u009d: For instance, carbon nanosheet electrodes that intercalate Na ions at C/3 are assumed to operate comparably at much higher rates. A wide survey of existing scientific literature shows minimal discussion regarding any transitions in dominant charge storage or capacity loss mechanisms as the charging rate is increased. Moreover, while there is a wide variability in the Coulombic efficiency and cycling lifetime values reported for 2-D carbons with Na, the origin of either is not understood. This combined experimental \u00e2?? simulation proposal seeks to provide new fundamental insight into these unexplored aspects of Na charge storage in 2-D carbons with a range of structure and chemistries. \n\nOur modeling effort will combine various state-of-the-art theoretical methods. It will address the fundamental issues regarding the Na ion storage behavior at the interface between electrolyte and the carbon. The role of graphene ordering, various carbon defects, and heteroatom chemistry will be considered in detail. We will systematically employ graphene-like carbon nanosheet electrodes as model anode structures containing nanopores, topological defects, heteroatoms (B, N, P, S), and combined dopant-defect complexes. This unique proposed work speaks to the core of the structure-properties relations in an emerging class of Na based energy storage systems (NICs and NIBs). It will answer the fundamental questions regarding how Na is reversibly and irreversibly stored within imperfect carbons. With the successful execution of this research, it is expected that many of the existing \u00e2??battery-inherited\u00e2?\u009d paradigms regarding high rate Na storage would be disrupted.",

Use of nanomaterials in various industries is projected to increase dramatically an environmental contamination by these materials. Since it is still largely unknown how nanoparticles will impact the environment, nanotechnology could lead to serious environmental problems.  Moreover,  there is still a substantial need to comprehensively investigate all physicochemical and biological properties of nanoparticles to predict possible impact.\n\nThe goal of the NSF CREST Interdisciplinary Center for Nanotoxicity (ICN) at Jackson State University is to develop an understanding of the potentially complex interplay between properties of different  nanomaterials and the health of ecosystems (impact to environment) using computational and experimental approaches. The Center analyzes the basic properties of the investigated nanoparticles that will lead to the thorough understanding of their behavior in physical processes, environments, relationship between physicochemical properties and biological activity/toxicity. Detailed physicochemical and toxicological characterization of different nanomaterials will ultimately have numerous applications in the industry and environmental hazard assessments and certainly will lead to development of reliable risk and safety evaluations to ensure their safety for human health and the environment. The activity of the Center is focused on the following directions:\n\n1. Physicochemical properties of nanoparticles. Computational and experimental prediction of  fundamental physicochemical properties, including quantum-chemical parameters, size-dependent parameters, composition-dependent parameters, and surface-dependent parameters that determine the intrinsic features of nanoparticles.\n\n2. Interactions of nanoparticles with biological systems and small molecules. The studies are carried out by comprehensive ab initio quantum-chemical calculations at high level of theory for small systems and using hybrid molecular mechanics/quantum-mechanical, classical force files and docking methods for larger systems.\n\n3. SAR studies, toxicity effects and environmental risks assessment of nanoparticles. The structure-activity paradigms applicable for nanoparticles are developed. According to this concept, the structure-property relationships and especially, the nanoparticle-toxicity relationships for different endpoints are being comprehensively investigated to reveal the mechanisms of nanoparticles toxicity and then to use such information to assess the environmental risks.",

Examples of extreme conditions encountered in energy systems include exposure to chemically reactive  corrosive  environments as aqueous fluids in fossil and nuclear plants, fuel cells, and water splitting; reactive and non-reactive gases at extreme temperatures and pressures as in solid oxide fuel cells, hydrogen transmission and storage, nuclear reactors; ionic liquids in fuel cells and batteries; steam, gases and hydrocarbons in oil shale processing, coal liquefaction. The chemical reactivity in these environments is further accelerated in the presence of mechanical loads and radiation fields. For the general infrastructure, it is not uncommon to quote 3-5% of the Gross National Product of any country as the corrosion bill to the society [1]. Overcoming the barriers caused by the inability of todays materials to function reliably in these extremes is a major challenge to enable secure, affordable energy with minimal adverse environmental impacts. Revolutionary advances are needed in reducing the degradation of materials due to reactivity in these aggressive conditions to meet the future energy challenges. For this purpose, a fundamental understanding of the thermodynamics and kinetics of unit processes that occur at the atomic level under such corrosive environments is needed (1).\nThe goal of this research is to quantitatively uncover the mechanisms that govern the corrosion kinetics in two energy-related contexts. The results of this research will ultimately lead to the development of physics-based predictive models for corrosion and guide the design of more durable material surfaces. The first context is the corrosion of zirconium alloys that are currently the canonical nuclear fuel cladding in water cooled nuclear reactors (the most commonly used nuclear plants in the world). The second is corrosion of low-chromium steels in oil fields containing hydrogen sulfide rich fluids. While these two systems look different in application, the scientific commonality we focus is on the stability of passive surface films that are critical in corrosion of both material systems - those are the zirconium oxide surface films in the former, and iron sulfide surface films in the latter. We will accomplish our goal through a multiscale computational approach linking first-principles electronic structure methods with atomistic simulations. In the rest of this section we describe the current state-of-knowledge of the mechanistic aspects of corrosion in the above mentioned energy-related systems. This description will allow us later on defining our Proposed Research and justifying the requested computational resources for this research. \n",

The work on nanowires is part of a collaborative National Science Foundation (NSF) Focused Research Group project aimed at the development of methods for linking atomistic and mesoscale simulation methods in the study of catalyst-mediated nanowire growth. In this project classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are being employed to study the interfacial properties governing nucleation and growth of the nanowire crystal from a liquid catalyst. The work on structrual alloys is part of an project aiming at the design of replacement materials for Re-based refractory alloys. The work involves the use of DFT methods to study the influence of solute additions on the mechanical properties of Re-based alloys. The third project is supported through an NSF graduate fellowship and deals with the design of high performance, high energy cathode materials employing DFT simulations.",

Initial attention to these materials was attributed to the discovery of the magnetic shape-memory effect in Ni2MnGa, which is now known as a prototypical \"smart material\". The magneto-structural coupling in Ni2MnGa allows a large external magnetic field to induce up to 10% reversible strain in this material, and vice versa, stress can cause up to 30% change in the magnetization. These properties gave rise to a number of new technologies, for example unique sensors and actuators. Search for better Heusler alloys becomes more intensive every year. Yet, microscopic understanding of what we are looking for in Heusler alloys is missing, because we have not identified the key physical observables that relate desired parameters of Heusler alloys with their chemical composition. The main objective of this project is to understand electronic origins of structural changes in Heusler alloys, and obtain theoretical phase diagrams, that would allow mapping of the physical properties of interest on the changes in stoichiometry of the material. It is proposed here to undertake a study of the electron-phonon interactions that should lead to a clearer connection between the electronic structure, phonon anomalies and chemical compositions. If the electron-phonon coupling is the key parameter that needs to be optimized, large-scale data based search in Heusler alloys can be undertaken.",

To scale up the superior mechanical properties of the individually confined nanometer-sized elements, load transfer and shear interactions must be optimized within the macroscopic material.  This great need has led to significant interest in the study of the fundamental deformation mechanisms of hierarchical layered materials composed of nanoscale elements. Designing such a class of layered materials draws its inspiration from Nature, who designs several strong and tough materials based on hierarchical structures, including bone, spider silk, and nacre from Red Abalone shell. For example, nacre is comprised of a hierarchical tablet-and-mortar structure of 95% brittle ceramic \u201ctablets\u201d (aragonite) and 5% organic polymer \u201cmortar\u201d.  This combination gives nacre a high modulus and a toughness that is ~3,000 times higher than the tablet material (aragonite) by means of a diffusive tablet sliding mechanisms, which is achieved by controlling material architecture, topology and interface properties. Here, we hypothesize that as in the case of natural materials, stiffness, strength, and toughness can be simultaneously optimized in novel composite materials, with hierarchical and discontinuous architectures, by selection of suitable building blocks, new interface chemistries, and constituent assembly with controlled geometrical overlap. The challenge is how does one identify the most promising combination of chemistry and geometrical overlaps, among the large number of possibilities available, for a particular combination of \u201ctablet\u201d and \u201cmortar\u201d building blocks?\n\nUnder the scope of the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI), we aim to accelerate the nanocomposite materials discovery and design, utilizing predictive computational models supported by highly selective experimental verification. While graphene has long been studied as a potential \u201cbrick\u201d for \u201cbrick-and-mortar\u201d nanocomposites, weak interfacial interactions between stacked sheets prevent effective scaling up. Graphene oxide (GO), a tunable, oxygen-functionalized derivative of graphene capable of strong interlayer hydrogen bonding, presents significant potential for overcoming this bottleneck.\n\nThe main objective for this project is the development of a predictive multiscale computational framework that accelerates the development of advanced materials. Specifically, the methodology proposed here focuses on the design of novel nanocomposites from multiple classes of materials, similar to computational alloys design, based on optimizing the materials selection, hierarchy and structure of the computationally predicted system. Inspired by natural materials such as nacre, we utilize GO and polymers as our building blocks. Through bottom-up computational modeling schemes, we aim to quickly assess the mechanical behavior of nanocomposites with different combinations of constituents as a function of hierarchy and structure of the system.",

Recently, we have been developing new encapsulation processes using these liquid-repellent materials. Even though designing such surfaces has shown to be very challenging, we aim at accelerating the creation and the optimization of these materials by using computational tools. In recent years, as a result of an increasing computational power of both mainstream and cutting-edge hardware, it has become possible and easier to study classical systems of hundreds of thousands of atoms over a few nanoseconds with classical molecular dynamics. Our main objective is to support our experimental results with computational models (why a given material is \"more\" efficient than another material), which would provide us with a better understanding of the underlying physical and chemical mechanisms in our systems. The first part of our project would mostly consist of a computational study of our new encapsulating techniques, and the different diffusion mechanisms that occur within these systems. The second part of this project focuses more on the design of liquid-repellent surfaces in general, which would eventually clear the path toward high-throughput computations to accelerate material design of liquid-repellent coatings and bio-inspired encapsulation processes. \nOur workhorse will mainly lie in classical molecular dynamics (MD) methods, with a possible support coming from Grand Canonical Monte Carlo methods. Depending on the results of these methods, our systems might also require hybrid quantum-classical molecular dynamics methods for investigation of our materials behavior at molecular scale.",

Soft materials encompass solid composites or liquid dispersions whose molecular species form the nanoscopic building blocks which assemble into structures spanning large length scales (angstroms to microns.) In addition to molecular-scale interactions between nanoscopic elements, the kinetics and thermodynamics of the structure and dynamics of these materials is dictated by physical forces which are predominant in these length scales: friction, electrostatics and hydrodynamics. The complex interplay between these key forces determines the structure or composition of these materials, and their responses to changes in the external environment such as acidity, temperature or light radiation. Fundamental insight into the morphology and dynamics of these materials will require the development and utilization of a suite of modeling tools with each class of tools tuned to address physical phenomena over a specific spatio-temporal scale. These multiple modeling techniques have to be interfaced at the juncture of two scales to enable a multiscale resolution of the system behavior over large length and time scales (nano-seconds to micro-seconds.) We harness these methodologies to develop a fundamental understanding of the various mechanisms underlying the interaction between cells and surfaces, for applications in targeted drug delivery, cellular sensing and antifouling. We are interested in the conception and design of bio-inspired membranes, vesicles, suitable biocompatible delivery vehicles and functionalized surfaces with specific interactions, via the use of mesoscopic computational models and techniques. The outline of the proposed work is provided below:\n1.\tDesigning bio-inspired membranes and vesicles \n2.\tMesoscopic implicit solvent models for bio-inspired bilayer vesicles \n3.\tDesigning sterically stable lipid-based delivery vehicles \n4.\tDesigning controlled-release delivery vehicles \n5.\tDesigning delivery vehicles via self-assembly of functionalized viral capsids \n6.\tRemoval of heavy metal ions using dendritic surfaces \n\tThe modeling and simulation techniques developed will require the utilization of state-of-the-art high-end fast-interconnect multi-core computing resources available at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC). The simulations for all the projects will be carried out on TACC Stampede using an open source Molecular Dynamics (MD) code entitled Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) [1]. To compare the run time measurements for the different number of processors, we measure the run Time per number of Particles per number of Iterations (TPI) for different number of processors. All computational models will be rigorously tested and bench-marked prior to the production runs for system scales of interest on TACC Stampede.",

The first grant (DMR-1808011) seeks to understand interactions in hybrid materials composed of 2D semiconductors and functional polymers. The functional polymers are tailored to contain specific moieties that enable precise, spatially-targeted control over work-function and charge-carrier doping of the 2D material. The second grant (CBET-1803614) will study metal core-2D shell nanoparticles designed for stabilization of catalytically active phases of the 2D materials and optimal control of catalytic activity and selectivity. Both projects involve the application of first-principles modeling as a key step in informing rational selection and design of hybrid organic-inorganic materials and core-shell nanoparticles, elucidating their fundamental physico-chemical properties, and providing mechanistic understanding into complementary experiments. The primary electronic structure code to be used for these two projects is the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP). We are requesting resources on Stampede2 that has the most recent optimized binaries of this code and where we have run all of our reported benchmarks using our startup allocation.",

This also requires moving away from bulk CMOS in Si with SiO2 gate dielectrics.  It will probably involve the use of a buried strained Si layer for channel mobility enhancement and high-k dielectrics for gate leakage current reduction.  However, little is known about the fundamental behavior and properties of defects and dopants in strained Si layers and their interfaces with a-SiO2, (let alone high-k dielectrics). \nWe perform first principles calculations to determine: structure, stability, and bonding of defect and dopant clusters in amorphous/strained Si layers; formation and diffusion of mobile defect and defect-dopant complexes in strained Si layers and in the vicinity of a-c Si interfaces; and defect annihilation and dopant precipitation at strained-Si/a-SiO2 interfaces. \nWe perform first principles based classical molecular dynamics (or ab inito tight binding molecular dynamics, if necessary) simulations to examine complex dynamics occurring in amorphous Si.  Emphasis is placed on understanding: recrystallization of amorphous pockets in the presence of strain and defects; and dynamic behavior of defects in the vicinity of amorphous pockets.  The fundamental findings contribute to developing improved kinetic models for defect profiles during the early stages of post-implantation annealing.",

The goal of this project is to investigate rod-coil block polymers\u2019 unique phase behavior under solvent effect so as to rationalize experimental design. The proposed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations will provide important insight into the complex phase driving forces, including microphase separation, anisotropic interactions and the solvent effect. The simulations will also elucidate the mechanisms of polymers self-assembling in the solvents environment. This project requires an exploration of multiple, long MD trajectories for ensembles of millions of atoms under different conditions: different solvents, polymer concentrations and polymer chemistry. In the mean time, drawing on atomistic MD simulations, we will develop polymer coarse-grained model and high efficient lattice simulation to study polymer supramolecular structures under solvent effect at mesoscopic scale.\n\nThe simulations will be performed using the software packages of Gromacs, Lammps and our own code. We have carried out preliminary simulations of the systems of 1.2 million atoms in shorter time (less than 100 ns) using atomistic MD simulations.

First-principles theory is ideal for investigating such interactions. However, first-principles calculations are severely limited by the supercell size, making it difficult to predict the solute and impurity effects on the stability and mobility of defects involving complex atomistic structures, such as dislocation kink formation/migration, twinning nucleation/propagation, and grain boundary complexions. Recently, the PI and his research group discovered a series of strong correlations between defect energetics and local electronic structures in several types of advanced transition metal alloys. These new findings provide the means to predict the complex defect-solute interactions accurately by understanding the chemical bonding mechanisms at the electronic level. \n\nIn the NSF CAREER project starting from April 1, 2019, the overall objective is to develop new computational approaches to study the defect-solute interactions and their effects on mechanical properties of advanced transition metal alloys by bridging the gaps between electronic, atomistic and mesoscale levels. In this one-year XSEDE project, there are two specific targets. First, it is targeted to perform systematic first-principles calculations for defect-solute interactions for multiple types of defects and solutes, which will provide enough datasets for the PI\u00e2??s group to identify generalized and quantitative correlations between local electronic/atomistic structures and defect-solute interactions in order to formulate computational methods to defect formation and migration energies. The matrix elements will be bcc refractory metals (W, Ta, Mo, Nb, etc.). The solute elements will be a series of transition metal elements with different numbers of d electrons (such as Hf, Re, Os, and Pt, etc.). Second, it is targeted to apply accurate empirical interatomic potentials and genetic algorithm to construct the atomistic structures of complex defects, such as high-angle grain boundaries and curved dislocations with alloying atom segregations. These complex defect structures will be used for future studies of defect stability and mobility once the computational methods in the first objective are achieved. To accomplish these two targets, the PI requests 41,305 SUs in Stampede2.",

This involves larger basis sets and correspondingly larger resources.\nb) we observed an apparent electronic transition in Ta at high pressure, which turned out to be artifact that disappeared after increasing the k-point mesh.\nThese two issues roughly lead to a factor 6 increase in computational requirements (relative to the estimates of our original proposal) and affect roughly 50 high-pressure data points (out of the original 200). Our additional requirements are therefore:\n6 x 1500 SU/point  50 points = 450 000 SU.\n\n2) As we were carrying out the computational characterization of the phase diagram of Zn-Sb-based thermoelectrics, new experimental evidence became available that indicated the potential presence of a new compound in the phase diagram that needs to be investigated. Unfortunately, this new compound turns out to have an extremely low symmetry (only inversion symmetry is present!). As a result, each structural energy calculation (to explore various point defect structures that contribute the non-negligible configurational free energy of the compound) requires about 4 times more resources to complete and we need about twice as many of them. Our additional requirements are therefore:\n(2 x 300 structures)  (4 x 100 SU/structure) = 240 000 SU\n\nIn summary, we would need an additional 690 000 SU.\n",

Using our grant from last year, we accomplished most of what we outlined as a plan of research in last year's proposal, and submitted several papers based on that work: 1) we have determined the equilibrium particle shapes for olivine structure LiFePO4 and LiMnPO4 and calculated the energy barriers for lithium in the bulk region to diffuse out at the (010) surface. These factors control the morphology and performance of this important class of Li ion battery cathode materials. 2) We have calculated the bending strain energy, defect energy and interfacial energy in TiS2 nanotubes, and determined the optimal bending angle. These calculations permit a better understanding of the structure of inorganic nanotubes, which is crucial to accurate calculations of their electrochemical and other properties for Li ion battery applications. 3) We constructed the Pourbaix diagrams for both bulk and 0.5 to 2 nm diameter Pt nanoparticles, which helps us understand and improve the stability of Pt nanocatalysts. 4) We developed a method based on the cluster expansion formalism that makes highly accurate thermodynamic calculations of nano-structured materials computationally feasible, and applied it successfully to our test system of Au-Pd nanoparticles to predict ground state structures. This method allows us to extend our computational work to alloyed nanoparticles that are too large for the fully ab initio approach. We are requesting an allocation to allow us to advance our studies on several areas: in Li ion battery materials we will 1) continue the study of LiFePO4 nanoparticles with adsorbates to study how the equilibrium particle morphology is modified by different solution environments and predict optimal synthesis conditions, and 2) study lithiation reactions in alloyed metallic and oxide nanoparticles. 3) In fuel cell catalysis we will investigate the effects of alloying on Pt catalysts. 4) We will also evaluate different quantum mechanical, continuum and hybrid model in the study of electrochemical properties of room temperature ionic liquids for electrolyte and other applications. 5) We will evaluate the optical and transport properties of candidate materials for photovoltaic applications using the GW approximation. The amount of units we are requesting this year is higher than last year's allocation because of the fact that we are expanding our research program to include additional areas of energy technologies and also because of the increased complexity in our calculations.",

We plan to perform a thorough investigation of the wake dynamics as well as the length scales and composition of the turbulent eddies in the wake, in order to understand the effect of these length scales on the generated power by wind turbines. This study is spurred by our recent results obtained with the help of our previous XSEDE research allocation (#TG-ENG150019) that pointed to an appearance of long coherent vortices in the wind turbine arrays that can be responsible for the power generation. This also led us to a relatively new idea of harvesting additional power by designing a symbiotic ``vertically-staggered'' wind farm with the collection of large and small turbines, which we plan to investigate with the current allocation. The data for several different wind farm configurations, with and without the smaller turbines, will be collected using Large Eddy Simulations with in-house Spectral-Element code Nek5000 and analyzed with the advanced analysis tools that we are developing for this purpose, including spectral analysis and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition.  The LES and wind turbine models for this research were developed for Nek5000 and validated by our group with the previous XSEDE allocations as well as using smaller in-house clusters. The code itself and the developed models are heavily parallelized, and have satisfied the code performance scaling as discussed in the main document. The research we propose to do is important not only from the fundamental prospective, but also as a means to help design and optimize realistic wind farms in the future and provide reduced-order turbulence models, for example, for RANS or other less expensive methodologies.",

An optimal catalytic material will be highly active for a desired reaction while selective against non-desired reactions that reduce process efficiency and create unwanted byproducts.

Quantum chemical calculations have become an essential tool in connecting catalyst and environment to the resulting activity and selectivity, guiding rational design of catalysts and catalytic processes.

Small pore zeolites (e.g. TON) exhibit higher selectivity towards lighter hydrocarbons, as well as lower rates than zeolites with larger cavities such as MFI, which are more selective towards gasoline-range hydrocarbons. Light alkenes (such as ethene, propene, and isobutene) are primarily formed via an aromatically co-catalyzed process. It is unknown, however, which aromatic species are most effective at co-catalyzing alkene formation, which alkene is the preferred product, and the exact mechanism for this co-catalyzed cycle. These aromatic co-catalysts can also react with alkenes to form polycyclic (e.g. naphthalene) coke precursors which lead to zeolite deactivation. The zeolite framework and location of the Brnsted acid site within the zeolite can have an effect on the reactivity, selectivity, and deactivation rates, because the diverse environments within the zeolite framework stabilize intermediates and transition states to different extents. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations will be used in this work to investigate three mechanisms of aromatically-co-catalyzed alkene (C2-C4) formation using a variety of aromatic co-catalysts at multiple acid-site locations within the MFI zeolite. These efforts will determine the critical steps which ultimately control the rate, selectivity, and deactivation of MFI during MTH reaction, which will enable the rapid evaluation of a wide range of frameworks.",

The proposed research will use DFT and high-level quantum mechanical computations, as a part of our ongoing effort to extend the mechanistic studies for C-H activations in methanol ODH reactions to various small reactant molecules of relevance in industrial processes for production of energy, fuels and chemicals, and to probe the mechanism of O2 activation required for re-oxidizing the catalyst reduced in the C-H activation step. We anticipate that the proposed research involving comparisons at different levels of theory, together with experimental work being performed at the LSAC laboratory, will establish a new state of the art for computational studies of selective oxidations and advance our understanding of general trends of reactivity in these reactions with reactant and catalyst properties.  The O2 activation calculations will lead to improved understanding of re-oxidaiton mechanism reduced metal oxides; prevalent reactive species such as surface-peroxide-type electrophilic oxygen will potentially be determined from such calculations will help guide experiments that specifically scavenge these species via O-insertion reactions.",

We have recently developed a methodology for testing the durability of Pt-based alloys via computational determination of the electrochemical potential shift with respect to pure platinum. For this, we use the VASP program to compute the surface chemical potential of slab systems. The calculations are done with and without the presence of adsorbed atomic oxygen.",

My group research has been on parallel high-order finite elements with application to MHD and atmospheric sciences. It is time for us to test the scalability of our algorithms on a large number of cores. Our driven applications are large-scale magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and large-scale atmospheric applications.  \n\nWe plan to present some preliminary results on scalability in a conference in two weeks. For that reason, we hope that we can obtain a TACC allocation soon. This will facilitate our progress to showcase our research work at UT Austin via TACC. This in turn helps strengthen UT reputation in general and TACC reputation in particular.\n\nRegards,\n\nTan Bui",

While rapid progress in the numerical modeling of subduction has enabled us to reconcile a wide range of local subduction observations, typically such models do not link individual subduction zones to the rest of Earth's global tectonic and convective system (i.e. they consider \u00e2??regional\u00e2?\u009d models of isolated subduction systems). Taking advantage of recently developed computational tools for simulating mantle convection, this project focuses on developing a quantitative framework to relate local subduction zone processes (those observed in regional settings/models) to tectonic processes operating elsewhere on the globe, in order to move beyond a strictly regional view of subduction dynamics. This framework will be used to assess the mechanical viability of large-scale subduction events proposed in plate reconstructions (tectonic plate models that aim to piece together Earth's geological evolution). In order to extrapolate this subduction framework deep into geological time, an additional component of this project will investigate the dynamics of Archean subduction (>2.5 Gyr ago), by comparing a suite of model predictions to a compilation of geological observations. Taken together, the two project components will provide quantitative constraints on how plate boundaries interact mechanically, and how this has evolved through Earth history.",

The computational models are closely linked to a wide variety of observations, including seismicity, the seismic structure of the earths interior, the kinematics of plates and the geological evolution of the continents. This allocation covers three science topics covered in three proposals funded by the NSF.  First, we use time-dependent, spherical models of mantle convection that are closely linked to plate kinematic models. A key objective of this work is to understand the long-term topographic evolution of continents and sea-level change. We will also be able to use the outputs of these global models to better understand the dynamics of the lowermost mantle. Second, we use a new finite element model with multi-physics to look at the detailed dynamics of a process called subduction (this is the process when a plate is returned to the earths interior). Third, we will look at the initiation of subduction, a major unknown in plate tectonics. We have requested 9.4M SUs on the TACC Stampede platform and have demonstrated good to excellent parallel scaling for the two software packages that well be using.",

ITDEaSM will be developed by coupling and adding capability to a suite of community models to address grand challenges in decadal regional climate predictions and fill in major gaps in existing climate, Earth system, and ecosystem modeling.  Multi-decadal simulations will be performed using ITDEaSM to estimate the long-term impacts of global climate changes on the global-through-urban earth system, including air quality, water quality/supply, forest, and ecosystem.  Our ultimate goal is to quantify such impacts, reduce associated uncertainties, and identify technology choices for co-benefits of climate/Earth system mitigation. During this 1-year allocation time period, our work will focus on model improvement, testing, and initial applications, which will be conducted by 4 post-Ds and 8 graduate students in our project team.  A complex Earth system model like ITDEaSM requires significant high performance computing resources.

XSEDE computing resources will enable CAPS to conduct high-resolution urban and regional climate simulations to address the following important issues.      \n\nCities are currently facing unprecedented challenge due to continued global urbanization and global warming.  Nowadays, more than half of population live in cities, and this fraction is expected to increase to two thirds in the following half century. The high dwelling intensity leads to a few urban environmental issues, such as urban heat island (UHI), urban air pollution, and urban water crisis. High-resolution numerical model simulations were proven very useful to investigate these issues [Hu and Xue, 2016; Hu et al., 2013]      \n\nThe Great Plains region is known for frequent hazardous convective weather and climate extremes.  Future climate in the Great Plains is projected to be more arid as temperature and evapotranspiration increase with an increased frequency of extreme precipitation events - essentially drought punctuated by flood.  Previous climate assessments in this region using coarse-resolution GCMs have largely avoided any conclusions regarding potential changes of hazardous convective weather due to their inability to simulate these small scale extreme processes. Probabilistic high-resolution dynamically downscaled climate projection is warranted to provide the information needed for key local decision-making at relevant (field-level) scales, especially for a region such as the south Great Plains [Sun et al., 2016].",

The largest uncertainty in quantifying the radiative impacts of human emissions on the present and historical climate is caused by the interaction of aerosols with clouds. From a computational modeling standpoint, the main challenge is the multi-scale nature of the problem. Conventional global climate models rely heavily on suboptimal parameterization of cloud-scale processes. On the other hand, global simulations that resolve cloud-scale processes are still prohibitively expensive. \n \nIn this XRAC proposal, we address this problem by combining the strengths of a multi-scale model and machine learning techniques to better advance our understanding of aerosol-cloud interactions. We will run the multi-scale Ultra-Parameterized Community Atmosphere Model (UPCAM) that embeds large-eddy resolution cloud resolving models within larger domain climate model columns and train a neural network with the model output to leverage machine learning techniques to estimate the impact of aerosols on cloud radiative properties. First, we will catalogue present-day aerosol-cloud relationships using UPCAM simulations. Second, we will compare simulations with present-day and pre-industrial emissions of aerosols to quantify the impact of anthropogenic aerosol emissions on cloud properties. Third, a neural network will be trained on the output from the UPCAM simulations to test the viability of the neural network predicting the effect of anthropogenic aerosol emissions on cloud properties.",

In the first project we plan to study extended wind farms with large eddy simulations (LES). Specifically, we will use and further develop the code we currently use to simulate large wind-parks. Our code is based on a spectral method in the horizontal direction, and finite differencing in the vertical direction. Wind turbines are represented by smoothed actuator-disk force fields. Significant resources are necessary for our exploration of various wind farm configurations to study the mechanisms that control the relative power output of wind turbines downstream. For a wind farm with a stream-wise spacing between the turbines of $7.85D$ and the span-wise spacing of $5.23D$, where $D$ is the diameter of the wind turbines, we changed the configuration of the wind farm by adjusting the alignment of the wind turbines with respect to the incoming wind. For this case, $\\psi=0$ degrees corresponds to an aligned wind farm, while a perfectly staggered configuration occurs at $\\psi=\\arctan[(5.23D/2)/7.85D]=18.43$ degrees. For aligned wind farms the simulations show a strong decrease of the power output of downstream wind turbines with respect to the first row of wind turbines. With increasing $\\psi$ the power loss in subsequent turbine rows is more gradual and surprisingly we find that highest average power output is obtained for some intermediate alignment of about $11$ degrees. To get a better understanding of this phenomenon and in order to generalize the results, we need to perform simulations for different stream-wise and span-wise spacings between the turbines to identify the general mechanisms that are responsible for this effect. In addition, we want to investigate the wake recovery behind large wind turbine parks and the effect of changing wind directions on the wind dynamics in the wind farms. \n\nIn the second project we plan to use our direct numerical simulation (DNS) code of channel flow for a large simulation that will generate high fidelity data for the Johns Hopkins University turbulence database cluster (JHU-TDC). Data from this facility is freely available to the scientific community. The JHU-TDC (http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu/) currently contains 27 TB of data for forced isotropic turbulence and 56 TB of data for forced magneto-hydrodynamic turbulence. All of these data are made publicly available through web services in which clients can retrieve spatio-temporal data consisting of the primitive variables and also additional data such as gradients, particle paths, etc.\\ which are evaluated in-situ at the database server. Spatial and temporal interpolation functions are implemented to provide continuous treatment of the discrete fields. We will then utilize the JHU-TDC service to study stress distributions and small-scale structures near the wall. To be specific, we want to compare the simulations with recent experimental work that found two types of buffer layer structures i.e., a pair of counter rotating vortices and multiple stream-wise vortices. Both of these structures are found to correspond to strong wall stress events. The database enables us to visualize the pre-history of flow structures by being able to follow the evolution backwards in time. We require significant resources to run the simulations at a friction-velocity based Reynolds number of $1000$, which requires a grid of $2048\\times512\\times1536$ grid cells. We plan to use XSEDE facilities to perform such a simulation, which will require $\\sim 10^5$ time-steps at the aforementioned resolution and use MPI-DB, a parallel database service developed at Johns Hopkins, to create the database.\n\nBoth the wind energy and channel flow database projects have been funded by corresponding NSF grants, and therefore have already undergone peer-review processes.",

Large-eddy simulations (LES) has been used for process-scale simulations under idealized conditions, such as fixed wind speed and direction, and constant static stability. It is difficult to compare results of such idealized simulations with observations because atmospheric conditions are dynamically evolving in time, due to the diurnal variation. Another source for dichotomy between observations and simulations is that computational studies are very often carried out for a single isolated turbine, or for infinitely-large wind farms leading to the fully-developed wind-turbine array boundary layer. Field observations, however, are for large but finite-sized wind farms, where the number of turbines is at most of the order of a few hundreds. \n\nThe primary aim of this work is to study the performance of a large, finite-sized wind farm under realistic atmospheric forcing using LES. The Firewheel Wind Energy Complex (FWEC) will serve as the primary testbed. This wind farm which is currently under development on the Oklahoma-Texas border is projected to be one of the largest wind farms in the world with over 1200 horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWTs) and will serve as a primary energy source for the Plains and Eastern Clean Line, a new concept for long-distance, high-voltage DC transmission. Our partners in this project, Map Royalty, Inc. are leading the development at the FWEC, and have provided us with historical meteorological data from that site. A computational allocation to perform numerical simulations, informed by the available historical meteorological data, at unprecedented resolutions, would be a unique opportunity to study realistic flow physics of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and the wind farm.",

This includes cell phones, diesel fuel injectors, ultrasonic transducers, and various vibration sensors. To date, lead zirconate titanate (PZT) based materials is one of the most widely exploited and extensively used piezoelectric materials. However, lead oxide, which is a component of PZT, is highly toxic and causing environmental concerns [1]. Searching for the lead-free, but with a similar performance, piezoelectric materials is very important. So far, one of the very promising materials is the sodium potassium niobate, e.g. K0.5Na0.5NbO3, referred to as KNN. \n  The KNN based materials have been extensively studied in experimental research since the end of 1990s. But it is still a challenge for first-principles study. Recently, the function to calculate the piezoelectric properties have been developed and implemented in the density-functional theory (DFT) based software packages. Here we propose to study the doping effects on the piezoelectric properties of the KNN based materials by using DFT computations. The major methods/codes to be used in the research will be DFT-based VASP and Quantum Espresso packages. \n\tThe objective of this proposal is to identify and investigate, through the first-principles calculation of the piezoelectric properties, the influence on the KNN-based materials by the various potential dopants.

Under the large electrochemical driving forces inherent to practical use, they frequently exhibit unique phase transition behavior not seen in other systems. An improved understanding of phase transformation pathways in electrode materials upon electrochemical cycling will lead to new materials design concepts and electrochemical duty cycle management strategy that improve capacity utilization and extend battery life. In this project we aim to obtain a fundamental understanding of phase transformation processes in important battery electrode materials with the help of high-performance computing. Mesoscale phase-field simulations will be employed as the main tool for the study. We will develop parallel MPI code to run simulations on TACC clusters. The code will utilize numerical packages such as Petsc, FFTW and Hypre that are available on TACC. Both small-to-medium (50-200 cores) and large-size (>1000 cores) simulations are planned for systems with single or multiple electrodes particles. Initial model materials include lithium transition metal olivine cathode and silicon anode, and may be extended to additional systems at the later stage of the project. Output from the simulations will be compared against in-situ X-ray diffraction and transmission microscopy experiments to explain the phase transformation phenomena in the selected systems and shed light on potential ways to further improve their performance.",

Understanding the physics of these jets is a key challenge in plasma astro- physics, for they are a powerful natural mechanisms of energy transport.\nOne paradigm to explain the formation of jets in PPN, in particular, is that of a binary stellar system in which material from the wind of an AGB star is gravitationally pulled onto an intermediate-mass companion. A hot magnetized rapidly rotating plasma disk will be formed about the companion star. The rotational and magnetic energy of this disk will then lead to the launch and collimation of jets. Several fundamental questions remain open in this scenario however. In particular which kinds binaries, (i.e. for which separations and mass ratios), form stable accretion disks? Do all disks form jets? What affects the stability of disk driven jets?\nBased on novel results obtained with our previous start-up XSEDE allocation (TG-AST120029) we propose to carry out a series of three-dimensional Adaptive Mesh Refinement parallel numerical simulations to study the formation, struc- ture and stability, and observational implications, of interacting stellar binaries. This will include (1) accretion from the primary AGB wind onto a secondary star and (2) launch and propagation of strongly magnetized jets. Our compu- tations will be performed with higher resolution and longer time-scales than attempted in previous studies and we will be using our locally developed, well tested code AstroBEAR 2.0 for the simulations. Binary-formed accretion disks will be investigated for stellar separations of 10, 20, 30, 40astronomical units and for mass ratios of 1.5. We will also study strongly magnetized jets in both adiabatic and cooling regimes using toroidal-to-poloidal magnetic component ratios of .1, 1, 10, 100.\nWhile we are in full production mode with AstroBEAR 2.0 the numerical resources of the XSEDE that we are requesting are needed to make further progress on unraveling the fundamental questions concerning interacting bina- ries and their disks/outflows. To achieve this goal we request the support of 4 million SUs on Kraken at NICS and 4 million SUs on Ranger at TACC.",

The primary research objective is to minimize the uncertainties in radiative and collision atomic data for the iron-peak ions using novel computational methodologies and computer codes. The electron and photon interactions with iron-peak ions will be computed using the state-of-the-art B-spline Breit-Pauli R-matrix (BSR) computer codes. Accurate description of complicated atomic structure with almost half-filled 3$d$ shell is the key to the reliable and accurate computation of radiative transition and collision rates. The combination of B-spline box-based multichannel and multiconfiguration Hartree-Fock (MCHF) computational approaches has proven to be very effective in achieving high accuracy in the recent computation of atomic scattering parameters for atomic oxygen and Fe$^{8+}$ ion. Our research allocation request is based on the computation of atomic data for oxygen and some preliminary non-relativistic test calculation for Fe$^+$ using XSEDE allocated resources on the LSU SuperMIC and TACC Stampede. We request 40,000 node hours on Stampede 2 and 500,000 service units on SuperMIC to compute transition rates and electron excitation collision rates of the Fe$^+$ ion. XSEDE resources are essential for us to succeed in this work. The reliable and accurate atomic parameters for Fe$^+$ ion are important to the analysis and interpretation of the spectra of stellar and nebular objects.

Our work relates to predicting the operations of electrospray micro thruster engines, which use ionic liquids (ILs) in the presence of an applied electric field to generate thrust using Taylor cone. Taylor cone are generated by IL in a capillary when a strong electric field is applied between the tip of the capillary and an extractor plate. Even though Taylor cone are a widely known and have wide range of applications, the process of formation and physics behind Taylor cone is still not well understood. Molecular dynamics method (MD) allows us to understand the underlying electro-chemical interactions at an atomic level, in the formation and emission from the Taylor cone.\n   MD methods scale on the order of number of atoms present in the system. Electrospray simulations require a large number of molecules and long simulation times due to the non-equilibrium nature of these simulations. We have proposed to use and successfully developed coarse grained (CG) model, which aim to reduce the number of atoms required to represent the system. This allows us to run large MD simulations with high computational efficiency. Using the `startup' allocation awarded to us, we developed and demonstrated the use of CG model of Ethylammonium Nitrate (EAN).\n   We are requesting `research' allocation for 522,240 SUs to perform electrospray simulations coupled with Poisson solver. Space charge broadening is a phenomena observed in electrospray emission, where the ions/ion agrregates have a tendency to form an over expanded jet. This behavior is not captured entirely using MD and so we propose to couple our MD simulations with Poisson solver, where depending on the position of the charged species, updated using MD, Poisson's equation will be solved to generate an electric field which is not constant throughout the domain. In the next time step, the electric field predicted by Poisson solver will used to calculate the forces on the atoms and their corresponding change in position using MD.",

The most successful approach for the identification of novel catalysts is known as computational catalyst screening, which encompasses three main steps: (i) the identification of the dominant reaction mechanism and the key reaction intermediates; (ii) the determination of a small set of catalytic reactivity descriptors that can predict reactivity and selectivity trends; and (iii) the calculation of these reactivity descriptors on new catalysts.\nIn the PIs group at the University of Houston (UH) we apply computational catalysis techniques, primarily DFT, to study catalytic process that enable the more efficient use of natural resources. This includes the utilization of abundant natural gas and biomass as fuel and feedstock for the production of valuable chemicals.

Understanding the molecular-level mechanisms that are responsible for the formation of an interface between Ras and other proteins, such as the downstream effector Ral, and in particular how oncogenic mutations of Ras alter the function of these interfaces, will provide new insight into the mechanism of Ras in tumor initiation and growth, and new strategies for successful drug design. Our group uses spectroscopic methods to measure electrostatic fields directly at the protein-protein interface. We aim to connect our experimental measurements with detailed atomistic models of the Ras-Ral interface and validate that connection through calculated electric fields.\n\nHowever, in order to calculate meaningful electric fields, the phase space distribution of protein and solvent degrees of freedom generally and the probe orientation specifically must be sufficiently sampled. Therefore, molecular dynamics simulations of the monomeric probe molecule alone and with its binding partner must be used to sample from the partition function most closely reflecting experimental conditions. Because there are tens of thousands of degrees of freedom for Ral and more than 100,000 for the Ras-Ral complex, sufficient sampling requires significant computational resources.\n\nHowever, there are many points of failure which may lead to poor calculations. For instance, the effect of force fields on probe orientational distributions is unknown, so several point charge and polarizable force fields must be tested to determine which lead to the most accurate electrostatic fields. Other factors including temperature (and the thermostat used to maintain that temperature), pressure, ionic strength, pH, methods for computing long-range forces, solvent model, initial conditions, modeling of protein structure for those residues without experimental coordinates, and many others add further complexity to the calculation.\n\nWe are requesting time on Stampede specifically to obtain good thiocyanate probe orientational distributions for Ral and the Ras-Ral complex for a single set of conditions: temperature, volume, force field, long-range force treatment, ionic strength and pH.

We will investigate the pathway of CH3OH electrooxidation reaction on the (111) facet of a series of Pt-based alloy catalysts. DFT calculations will be performed to obtain the free energy of adsorption of all chemical species, and heats of reaction and activation energies of all possible elementary chemical reactions in CH3OH oxidation. The calculated energetics (free energy of adsorption, heats of reactions, and activation energies) on Pt alloy catalysts will be used to search the best performing Pt alloy catalysts for CH3OH oxidation. Moreover, we will find an electronic descriptor of Pt alloy catalysts correlating with the activity of Pt alloys for CH3OH oxidation.",

The goal of CIGs efforts is to provide software that will help researchers and students address important unsolved problems in geophysics, including problems in mantle dynamics, crustal and lithospheric dynamics on both million-year and earthquake time-scales, and seismic wave propagation. CIG engaged in these activities under an MRAC and requested to upgrade to an LRAC in January 2008, as the positive response from the community has been consuming its present TeraGrid allocation at a substantially higher rate than anticipated. This proposal justification will answer questions and address issues raised by the LRAC Review Board. In the previously submitted LRAC application, CIG proposed to continue to promote four geodynamics codes through operation and further development of its science gateway and by pre-installing more codes in TeraGrids Community Software Area. The Seismology Science Gateway, already deployed, features SPECFEM3D_GLOBE, a spectral-element code that simulates global and regional (continental-scale) seismic wave propagation; SPECFEM3D, which simulates southern California seismic wave propagation, is a planned future addition. Three CIG finite-element codes (CitcomS, Gale, and PyLith) are all state-of-the art and scale well on a variety of TeraGrid platforms. Using a powerful, yet simplified interface that will run and benchmark these applications via a web browser, we hope to increase the ability of the Earth Sciences community to access TeraGrid resources. A benchmarking tool, the CIG Model Analyzer (Cigma), will also be offered as a web service. An allocation is requested for four activities: (1) operation and continued development of the science gateway, (2) benchmarking, (3) workshops and training sessions, and (4) nurturing new users on the TeraGrid using CIG software.",

Seismological and geochemical observations provide insights into the physics and chemistry of the Earth\u00e2??s interior. However, only by comparing mineral physics data (physical properties) with the seismological observations can we disentangle the thermal state of the deep Earth from its chemistry. Conventionally, as a first order approximation, the Earth\u00e2??s mantle is thought to be composed of a homogenous pyrolite. But, in reality, this region is far from being homogeneous. The distinct trace element signatures in mid ocean ridge and ocean island basalts reveal the heterogeneity in the Earth\u00e2??s mantle. Although the scale of the heterogeneity is unknown, it is likely that large regions of the mantle are composed of a depleted harzburgite and enriched crustal fractions. We have limited knowledge of the thermodynamics and physical properties of mineral phases in these subducted crusts at high pressures.\nWe propose to examine the elasticity of hollandite along a ternary system- [(K,Na)(1-x)CaxAl(1+x)Si(3-x)O8] where, 0<x<1. We will explore the pressure dependence (0-150 GPa) of the ferroelastic transition between hollandite I and hollandite-II. We will explore the effect of iron on the elasticity of hollandite. In particular, how iron spin pairing transition couples with the ferroelastic transition. Finally we will also explore the effect of hydrogen defect on the structure and elasticity of hollandite. We will integrate our understanding of elasticity of hollandite with other major phases such as stishovite and majorite garnet to constrain the elasticit signatures of the deeply subducted continental crust in the Earth\u00e2??s mantle.",

This work builds off our pilot study (Bustard et al. 2018) run on Stampede2 under a previous start-up allocation (TG-AST170033; PI: Chad Bustard,Co-PI: Ellen Zweibel). In this work, we used the FLASH magnetohydrodynamics code to simulate outflows from the LMC during it's infall through the Milky Way halo, and we found the interaction between weak \"fountain\" flows and the headwind experienced by the LMC to be important in ultimately expelling gas. Our proposed work will probe the additional effects of magnetic fields and cosmic rays, some of the most highly energetic particles in the universe, including a novel implementation of the so-called cosmic ray streaming instability. This extremely sub-grid interaction between charged cosmic ray particles and plasma waves has been approximated in a fluid treatment and can have large-scale effects on galaxy evolution. With these additions to our model, we will undertake a study of cosmic ray and thermally driven outflows from the LMC and SMC, varying key parameters such as method of cosmic ray transport, initial magnetic field strength,  and  level  of  supernova  clustering.  We  will  then  create  synthetic  observations  using extensively tested visualization toolkits,  and we will compare these directly to the wealth of observational data on the Magellanic System. By using the Clouds, two of the most well-studied extra-galactic objects in the Universe, as test-beds for outflow launching, we can, for the first time, connect resolved star formation histories and detailed observations of galaxies to their supernova-driven expulsions. Using observational constraints on the magnetic field strength, cosmic ray population, star cluster masses, etc., we can probe what works and what doesn't to launch the observed outflows. This is of vital importance to understanding how galaxies self-regulate their star formation by transferring gas to the intergalactic medium, and it will provide a useful case-study for dwarf galaxy evolution in general.",

Understanding how stars form is crucial even for seemingly unconnected fields of astronomy, Their formation includes a wide range of physical phenomena: both super- and subsonic turbulence, magnetic fields, weakly ionized plasmas, continuum and line radiative processes compounded by complex chemical processes and gravity, making the problem of star formation extremely complex. The difficulty is further compounded by the wide dynamic range of the problem: the process of star formation is initiated in giant molecular clouds (GMCs), which are 9 orders of magnitude larger than the protostars and stars that form in the end. \n\nOur goal is to understand the roles turbulence, magnetic fields, radiative feedback, outflows and the local environment play in star formation, on scales from individual stars and protostars to GMCs. The proposed simulations will be used to address the following questions:\n1) What physical mechanisms are responsible for setting the masses of individual stars? \n2) How do different feedback mechanisms (e.g., radiation, outflows) interact to regulate star formation in GMCs? \n3) What determines the physical properties of star clusters that form in a given environment? How do the properties of the progenitor cloud affect the mass, size, and density profile of the resulting star clusters? \n\nUnlike previous studies that were confined to a small region of a GMC, the simulations we propose here will provide a self-consistent picture of a cloud disrupted by long-range feedback (e.g., winds and radiation from O-stars, supernovae). We propose a series of runs with progressively more complicated physics: starting from pure isothermal collapse, then adding magnetic fields, cooling physics, dust, protostellar heating and outflows and main sequence stellar feedback.This step-by-step approach will allow us to identify the role of each physical process in star formation in a self-consistent framework for the first time.",

In the nearby Universe, galaxy properties vary dramatically as a function of both stellar mass and environment, but it is unknown when or how these differences were created.  To address this problem, one must target the critical epoch about 10 to 12 billion years in the past (redshifts between 1.9 and 3.5), when massive galaxies assembled, cosmic star-formation and black-hole accretion peaked, and the largest proto-clusters collapsed. Until now, systematic studies of this epoch have been hampered by a lack of data:  while a number of programs have the requisite deep imaging and  spectroscopy, none come close to sampling the full range of galactic environments, from the sparsely populated voids to the formation sites of massive clusters.  This collaborative program addresses this problem by uniting researchers at Penn State, UT-Austin, and Texas A&M in an investigation of a 24 sq deg patch of sky that is being studied by six major surveys. The synergy of optical imaging from the Dark Energy Camera, near-IR imaging from NEWFIRM, mid-IR imaging from Spitzer-IRAC, far-IR imaging from Herschel-SPIRE, X-ray imaging from Chandra, combined with future optical spectroscopy from the Hobby Eberly Telescope Dark Energy  Experiment (HETDEX)  will transform our understanding of an epoch when the universe was only 2 to 4 billion years old.",

Unfortunately, simulations run to the late Universe are forced to sacrifice physical and modeling detail due to computing limitations, which leaves the epoch fertile to observationally-constrained semi-analytic or empirical modeling efforts to bridge this gap. However, new phenomena and environments that lie on the edge of our observational frontier are less constrained and would benefit from a well-tested, first principles approach to numerical modeling. We propose to perform these tests by bringing full-physics ``zoom-in\" cosmological simulations forward to the present day whereupon we will conduct a thorough Monte Carlo radiative transfer analysis on the resulting galaxies. After comparing and validating our techniques against observations, we will then proceed to produce detailed, high-resolution mock catalogs of both local galaxies and their higher-redshift progenitors. We will be able to provide predictions of light to mass ratios, half-light radii, emission line strengths, UV luminosity as well as other measures and correlate them directly to the composition, evolution history, and inclination of various types of galaxies.

Here we study the mutual interplay between turbulence and magnetic reconnection by means of first-principle particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of electron-ion plasmas in magnetically dominated systems (i.e., in the \"relativistic\" regime). With this Research Allocation Request, which follows a Startup Allocation in which we assessed the scalability of the used code (TRISTAN\u00c2\u00ad-MP) on Stampede2, we want to perform large scale three-dimensional relativistic kinetic (both electrons and ions) simulations in order to investigate the effects of magnetic reconnection in the turbulent cascade and how this affects particle acceleration.

                    "project_abstract": "This is a request to continue our program of novel, high-resolution simulations of super-massive black hole (BH) growth and galaxy evolution, which will resolve the interstellar medium (ISM) and both fueling and feedback from BHs with fundamentally new physics on galactic scales. This will extend and improve on work over the last year using a previous XSEDE research allocation (Resolving Feedback from Super Massive Back Holes in a Realistic Interstellar Medium; PI Hopkins), particularly taking advantage of the numerical and physical advances that allocation enabled to generate a systematic suite of simulations studying feedback in different environments, which will be used to address a vast array of fundamental science questions.\nIn these simulations, the ISM will be explicitly resolved into diffuse and dense molecular cloud phases, with stars forming only in high-density bound cores, while both gravitational capture and accretion into the sub-pc scales of the viscous accretion disk by the BH will be explicitly resolved. When stars form, or mass is accreted onto the BH, energy and momentum is injected into the surrounding media via stellar and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. We self-consistently incorporate the effects of radiation pressure (from stars and the AGN accretion disk), stellar and accretion disk winds, supernovae types I & II, and photo-ionization as well as Compton heating (by stars and AGN). This generates explosive galactic outflows and drives turbulence within both dense and diffuse gas in galaxies.\nWe will use these simulations to for the first time study accretion and feedback from AGN while simultaneously treating the ISM on galactic scales in a realistic fashion, without ad hoc prescriptions which have been used in previous numerical studies. In this investigation, our proposed simulations focus on a range of scales, from small-scale simulations of the obscuring torus region which can resolve inflow into scales of the viscous BH accretion disk, up through fully galaxy-scale simulations. This will allow us to simulate a range of different processes and develop an understanding of how small-scale physics of AGN accretion and driving of accretion-disk winds impacts galactic star formation and evolution at a much larger scale.\nBecause of their unique realism and range of physics incorporated, the proposed simulations will be used to address a wide range of current open scientific questions. We will study the evolution of BH accretion rates, generation of nuclear and galactic-scale winds, the interaction of AGN- driven and stellar-driven galactic outflows, the effects of AGN feedback on galactic star formation, and the nature of BH-host galaxy correlations. XSEDE resources are necessary to provide the computational power to perform these simulations, as the resolution demands exceed what can be achieved with local computing resources. We will use the new code GIZMO, that allows us to run simulations with either a moving-mesh method, or a novel formulation of smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH). These simultaneously capture many of the advantages of Eulerian (grid) and Lagrangian codes, and allow us to directly isolate their discrepancies.\nWe have successfully performed test runs using the production version of the code on local computing clusters, and have run previous simulations using Stampede at TACC. This allows us to estimate runtime requirements for the proposed simulations, totaling 3.6 million SUs.",

The main science focus of this year's proposal is shifting from  the last year's isothermal simulations of turbulence on scales of 10pc and below towards multiphase interstellar turbulence simulations in larger boxes with linear size up to 250pc. Our new problem setup will include the effects of distributed heating and radiative cooling, magnetic fields, and self-gravity. With AMR technique, we will be able to resolve all relevant physical scales better than in existing multiphase simulations. A set of numerical experiments with effective grid resolutions up to 4,096^3 (0.06pc) will allow us to: (i) address the problem of molecular cloud formation, (ii) study the statistics of multiphase turbulent flows, and (iii) compare different driving mechanisms for interstellar turbulence and\ntheir imprints in turbulent statistics.

These materials promise the ability to produce a flexible, inexpensive, and thin solar cell as a structurally more versatile and economically more attractive alternative to silicon-based solar cells.  The efficiency of the relatively new OPV materials has not yet reached that of conventional silicon based solar cells and needs to be increased before wide scale commercial application can be realized. OPVs are efficient absorbers of light, but depend upon exciton diffusion, dissociation, and eventually electron-hole separation to generate photocurrent. Competing against these processes is the complementary set of exciton trapping, recombination, and radiative or non-radiative decay. Maximizing the former set and minimizing or negating the latter are available routes to improve efficiency and allow for OPVs to become a viable renewable energy source. Perhaps the most critical complicating factor in understanding OPVs is that the performance is highly sensitive to molecular order, and large variance in molecular order can be seen even within the same polymer, depending on processing protocol.  The research for which this proposal requests support is focused on understanding these performance factors on a fundamental and molecular level in order to aid in the understanding and design of OPV device performance.",

The unique electronic structure of graphene gives rise to many outstanding features and broad potential applications. However, the lack of a finite band gap is a big obstacle for the application of graphene on practical microelectronic devices because the intrinsic-graphene-based transistor cannot be switched off by the controlling voltage. Therefore, how to generate a finite band gap and, moreover, how to control the band gap are urgent and important research tasks.\n\nExperimental and theoretical studies have shown a few approaches to modify the electronic structure and band gap of graphene and bilayer graphene. We will focus on two of them; one is the chemical adsorption of molecules onto the graphene sheet; the other one is applying electric field to induce a finite band gap in bilayer graphene. For the first research topic, we plan to carry out first-principles studies to reveal how the molecules are adsorbed by graphene at the quantum-mechanics level and discover what kind of patterns these molecules prefer to form. For the second research topic, we will perform the first-principles calculation to study how the applied electric field induces a finite band gap in bilayer graphene. Many-electron effects will be included for the first time. Through this study we expect to explain the discrepancy between the prior theoretical calculations and experimental measurements and explore how important many-electron effects are in the electronic structure of two-dimensional semimetals. Finally, the change of the electronic structure induced by above methods will definitely have impact on the optical response of graphene and bilayer graphene. We plan to study optical absorption spectra of bilayer graphene under an applied electric field with many-electron effects included. Through this study, we hope to understand how electron-hole interactions modify the infrared optical absorption spectra of bilayer graphene with a finite band gap.\n\nIn order to realize above research plans, a powerful and efficient parallelized computing platform is of importance. Therefore, we write this proposal to TeraGrid for necessary computing allocation. We believe that these proposed plans will not only improve our understanding of the electronic structure and optical response of graphene but also significantly contribute to practical applications of this novel material. Moreover, our research plans will benefit the computational condensed matter research community in Washington University and St. Louis region and provide excellent opportunities for researchers to learn attractive properties of graphene and many-electron effects on nanostructures.\n",

Clearly, hierarchical methods that span quantum mechanics at the atomic scale up to macroscopic scale continuum models across disparate length and time scales are crucial for developing accurate and validated guidelines that can be used to design new materials and interfaces with revolutionary functionalities for efficient current and heat management. At the same time, we will develop a working understanding of interface structure and dynamics in nanostructured interfaces in order to define the descriptors of the dominant physical behaviors.

They include topological insulators, Dirac Fermions, metals, semimetals, semiconductors, and charge density waves.  Layers can be registered to each other or be randomly misoriented.  Random orientation can electronically decouple the layers even though they are only a few angstroms apart.  Electronic structure calculations coupled with a study of the vibrational properties of materials is required to understand the electronic, thermal, and thermoelectric properties.  One interesting subclass of materials are transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD), which exhibit semiconducting, semi-metallic and metallic conducting properties.  TMD compounds consist of covalently bonded trilayers (TL) that are held together by weak vdW forces along the c-axis.  Ab-initio calculations of the electron and the phonon properties can be used to understand a range of phenomena exhibited by this class of materials which includes novel electronic, thermal, thermoelectric, and charge-density-wave properties.  \n\nThis research is funded by the NSF-1124733 (NSF-NRI NEB 2020) and MARCO/SRC/DARPA through the center on Functional Accelerated nanoMaterial Engineering (FAME).\n",

We will focus on drastically reducing the power consumption for the matrix-vector multiplications that lie at the heart of least-squares or modified least-squares methods of the algorithmic detection of isotopes in spectra.\nPresent-day computational approaches are increasingly limited by the power consumption associated with memory and transferring data between different memories. We propose to develop topological-insulator random-access memory (TIRAM) that is non-volatile, energy-efficient, high-density, and does not require dedicated read-out circuitry. To realize such a device, we start from the exciting recent discovery of large-gap two-dimensional topological insulators (2D TIs). We will study 2D TIs coupled with 2D ferromagnets to exploit the ability of 2D TIs to inject electrons with a desired spin with 100% efficiency into ferromagnetic storage layers. We will study TIRAM intrinsic performance, the robustness against imperfections offered by topological protection, and the efficiency of performing matrix-vector multiplications using TIRAMs.\nIn a second stage of the research, we will investigate the combination of the newly developed memory with TI-based field-effect transistors (TIFETs) which have recently been shown to exhibit lower power consumption and higher performance than any alternative emerging computing device. The co-integration of TIRAMs with TIFETs will yield immediate significant power savings and can eventually lead to non-von Neumann brain-inspired artificial neural networks that can perform pattern recognition tasks orders of magnitudes more efficiently compared to any conventional approach.",

This research allocation will support an ongoing binational project, that has been awarded a three year NSF grant in 2017. The purpose of this broader project is to develop a reliable workflow for the calculation of excited state properties of semiconductors and insulators, using many body perturbation theory and range separated hybrid functionals (RSH). This project has evolved to include three main thrust areas: (1) access the ability of RSH to capture many-body effects relative to higher levels of theory, (2) devise an first principles material-specific framework for determining all parameters appearing in the RSH functional, and (3) use RSH as a starting point for more sophisticated many body calculations within the GW-BSE approach.  This proposal is concerned primarily with the third thrust area and structured as follows. In the main document we will give an outline of the scientific background of our research, followed by a detailed description of the methodology we employ, the milestones earmarked for this specific allocation, the research plan devised to achieve these milestones, as well as a point-by-point breakdown of the requested resources. Furthermore, we attach four auxiliary documents that include the list of references cited in this proposal, a separate discussion on the performance of the software we plan to use and the CVs of the PI (Jeffrey Neaton) and the co-PI (Marina Filip).",

They are reliable, non-polluting, require minimal maintenance, and can be operated over a wide range of temperatures.\nThis project aims at significantly increasing zT values of thermoelectrics by nanostructuring TE materials into NC solids that can offer high electrical conductivity while dramatically lowering the thermal conductivity. We propose an approach for creating completely new high-zT thermoelectrics via bottom-up assembly of TE NCs into binary nanocrystal superlattices (BNSLs). \n We will use ab initio modeling for predicting electrical and thermal transport in the NC superlattices, and corroborate the obtained results with the experimental data.

In this realistic real world setting, the projects will explore mostly the effects of policy changes on macroeconomic prices and quantities and asset prices.

However, validation of protein structures is often limited to global comparisons to static experimental structures, despite fluctuations in solution NMR that indicate that solvent-exposed amino acids interconvert between states in a thermodynamic ensemble. While it is well known that amino acids in globular cores remain tightly packed together, we recently identified a fixed percolation geometry in these regions that also persists in the presence of small mutations or thermal fluctuations. This key observation enables us to implement a novel technique that quickly validates physiological and pathological protein structures from MD, in addition to predicting putative structures based on the conservation of core residue percolation. Compared to traditional enhanced-sampling methods, where protein conformations are extracted from the most probable states, the use of side-chain percolation allows decoy states to be filtered out and discarded. As a result, simulations can focus on states that are thermodynamically consistent with known experimental ensembles, rather than on a singular protein fold. In order to develop this technique into a widely-utilized tool for efficient protein folding, we propose the following two projects: (1) to measure how often proteins implicated in physiological and pathological processes interconvert between known conformations as a result of MD fluctuations, and whether such fluctuations vary across popular force fields. (2) to identify how conformational mutations affect the interconversion between physiological and pathological states while conserving globular percolation, especially in the context of cancer and Alzheimer\u00e2??s Disease. Taken as a whole, the ability to filter true protein structures from energy-minimized decoys will greatly reduce the need for very long protein folding simulations and can inform how proteins pathological misfold within their thermodynamic limitations.",

Advanced data assimilation (DA) is needed to provide accurate initial conditions (IC) while optimized ensemble-based DA techniques such as the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) can provide theoretically the best possible estimate of the initial condition uncertainties what are needed to initialize ensemble forecasting systems.  \nCAPS has since 2007 continued to push the envelope of high-performance computing, conducting highly successful realtime storm-scale ensemble forecast (SSEF) experiments utilizing XSEDE computing resources at PSC, NICS and TACC, in collaboration with the NOAA Hazardous Weather Testbed (HWT) Spring Forecasting Experiment (SFE), and since 2016 the NOAA Hydrometeorological Testbed (HMT) Flash Flood and Intensive Rainfall (FFaIR) Experiment. CAPS realtime experiments are designed to test and evaluate the most advanced data assimilation systems and ensemble forecasting techniques designed for predicting high-resolution convective-scale weather, and the data sets generated will be used by the CAPS scientists as well as collaborators to help answer many scientific questions related to the prediction of severe weather. Close collaborating organizations include the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) operational centers (The Storm Prediction Center, Weather Prediction Center, and Environmental Modeling Center), research centers include the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the Developmental Testbed Center). The experiments are expected to lead to optimal designs and advanced capabilities that can be implemented at the NCEP Operational Centers, and thereby to improve forecasting of severe weather such as tornadoes, severe hail, damaging winds, and flash floods.  The CAPS forecast data sets generated on the TerGrid and Xsede resources have resulted in more than 40 referred journal publications. \nThrough this proposal, scientists from CAPS seeks XSEDE resources on TACC Stampede and PSC Bridges to support its 2017 realtime storm-scale ensemble data assimilation and forecasting and related research in collaboration with the 2017 HWT SFE and HMT FFaIR forecast experiments. Such research has large-scale computing requirements that can only be satisfied by XSEDE. New scientific questions will be addressed by the experiments.",

To further improve and develop new electronic switches that can be manufactured more cheaply and consume less power, new device concepts based on novel two-dimensional materials rather than conventional silicon technologies have been proposed and new research is needed to assess their potential properties. An important step in the development of such new electronic switches is computer simulations incorporating the physical elements that control the charge transport. Many important breakthroughs have been realized in electronic transport simulations and quantum transport is routinely simulated using a host of tools available to the community. However, all of these currently available tools start from the chemist's \"tight-binding\" viewpoint rather than from the physicist's \"plane-wave\" vantage point. Unfortunately, certain physical processes that are important in two-dimensional materials are difficult to be treated correctly using the tight-binding basis. The goal of this project is to transform the way quantum transport is studied by moving from the tight-binding basis to the plane-wave basis. This project will develop a plane-wave based quantum transport code capable of studying novel electronic devices. The project will also include a study of conventionally-scaled electronic devices as well as newly proposed devices and materials that present important routes toward the realization of a more energy-efficient electronics. This project will also generate a pipeline of students motivated to study science and engineering at universities through participation in various outreach programs at the University of Texas at Dallas. \n\nSpecifically, the project will develop a plane-wave based code capable of studying quantum transport in nanoscale devices such as nanowires and nanoribbons. Efficient plane-wave algorithms to reduce computational memory and time requirements and a robust capability of studying the effects of spin-orbit coupling will be implemented in the code. Electronic dissipative scattering in these nanoscale devices will be dealt with using the Pauli Master equation. Important physical phenomena that will be incorporated are: scattering with phonons, defects, and edge roughness. Of particular interest is scattering with the flexural out-of-plane phonons which are hard to describe in a localized basis set. The atomic-scale dielectric response in these low-dimensional systems will also be studied. Using the developed quantum transport code, a wide variety of devices, such as conventional field-effect transistors, tunneling-based field-effect transistors, and topological-insulator field-effect transistors, will be studied. The research will elucidate the impact of flexural out-of-plane phonon modes on the electronic-transport characteristics of low-dimensional materials. The effects of spin-orbit coupling on transport will be determined. How the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and the electron-phonon interaction affects transport will be clarified. Finally, the research will also unravel the important physical processes in future field-effect transistors and determine how to deal with possible detrimental effects such as line-edge roughness.",

These magnetic fields are sustained through the motion of electrically conducting fluids within their interiors via the so-called dynamo mechanism, which converts the kinetic energy of fluid motion into electromagnetic energy. Understanding the physics of these systems remains a challenging task due to the extreme physical parameters that characterize these systems. For instance, natural dynamos are typically dominated by two or more forces; the remaining forces are relatively small and play a very subtle role that remains poorly understood. Moreover, rotation and magnetic fields introduce inhomogeneity and anisotropy into the flow field and a general understanding of their influence on the statistics of turbulence is lacking. This proposal seeks to overcome this limitation by performing one of the most detailed investigations to date of convection-driven magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, with a particular focus on understanding how magnetic waves influence the dynamics. We will use a combination of state-of-the-art asymptotic models and high resolution direct numerical simulation of the complete set of governing equations.",

This proposal is based on two main projects that have been previously approved and funded by NSF: Project A. Quantum Materials from geometric and dimensionality design, reviewed and accepted by NSF-DMR, project date June 15, 2018 \u00e2?? May 31, 2021, award number: 1724791; Project B. Predictive theory, synthesis and characterization of a new type of transparent conductor without doping, reviewed and accepted by NSF-DMR, project date July 1, 2018 \u00e2?? June 30, 2021, award number: 1806939. In project A, we propose to build upon our recent successful preliminary work on geometric and dimensionality design to obtain Quantum Materials with emergent properties that greatly supersede or are even qualitatively absent from those attainable from the individual compound building blocks. The main \u00e2??knobs\u00e2?? involve a search for specific superstructure patterns (A)n/(B)m/(A)p/(B)n\u00e2??/\u00e2?\u00a6 (where n, m, p, n\u00e2??... are the repeat periods of the building blocks compounds A, B), or polymorphs with specifically reduced symmetries that deliver unusual, emergent quantum properties. In project B, we realize that the current method of choice for discovering new transparent conductors have relied on heavily doping transparent insulators until they become conducting, while unfortunately, wide gap materials are intrinsically resistant to doping of charges because of the existence of \u00e2??doping bottlenecks\u00e2??, thus consequently, the progress in finding and optimizing such technologically critical transparent conducting oxide materials has been frustratingly slow. We propose an opposite, and likely more fruitful alternative of designing transparency in metals by looking for compounds that obey a set of \u00e2??design principles\u00e2?\u009d with specific band structures. The design rules for our proposed intrinsic transparent conductors are: (i) identify a compound with metallic band structure; such that (ii) it has low plasma frequency and (iii) low inter-band optical absorption across the Fermi level, and (iv) apply synthesis and characterization to the \u00e2??best of class\u00e2?\u009d compounds. The most visible advantage of metallic transparent conductors is that their conductivity comes from their high, indigenous carrier concentration. Such rare compounds could not have been identified by chance, and currently require a trial-and-error Edisonian method.",

                    "project_abstract": "Magnetised turbulence plays a significant role in a variety of astrophysical and laboratory processes, ranging from the generation of large-scale magnetic fields in stellar interiors, to the transport of angular momentum in accretion discs and heating in the solar corona. Unfortunately, despite its wide-ranging applicability, magnetised turbulence has evaded a general physical understanding for many decades. The development of a firm theoretical foundation for magnetised turbulence remains one of the most important outstanding problems in astrophysics.\n\nThe development of the theory for magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence heavily relies on massively parallel numerical computations. The enormous increase in computational power over recent years has enabled high-resolution numerical simulations that have led to the discovery of an array of important new effects and a number of thought-provoking theoretical conjectures have been put forward. In particular, in the case of strong field-guided incompressible MHD turbulence it has been found that the turbulent domain spontaneously fragments into regions in which the velocity and magnetic fields are aligned within a small scale-dependent angle. The aligned structures have a number of important consequences, particularly on the efficiency of the energy cascade. Moreover, it has recently become apparent that our ability to measure the scale-dependence of the alignment angle, even at low Reynolds number where traditionally only a very short inertial range is detectable (thus making the identification of scaling laws difficult), may have uncovered a new result that could be related to a well-known phenomenon in isotropic hydrodynamic turbulence. The phenomenon is known as extended self-similarity, which refers to the empirical result that the universal region of self-similarity can be significantly extended if one plots a structure function versus a second structure function for which an exact expression is known, rather than naively plotting the structure function versus the increment. If this result can be extended to the anisotropic case of magnetised turbulence its implications will be widespread, as it will enable scaling laws to be determined from a statistical analysis of numerical or observational data sets of a much reduced resolution than would otherwise be necessary.\n\nThe aim is to investigate the phenomenon of extended self-similarity in the inertial range dynamics of strong incompressible MHD turbulence. We propose a series of high-resolution numerical simulations that will elucidate the character of this mechanism. The simulations will provide crucial information for developing a comprehensive phenomenological model of strong MHD\nturbulence and will provide a useful tool for inferring the scaling properties of MHD turbulence from astrophysical observations.",

With an advent of rigorous computational data analytics, recent brain imaging studies have begun to show promising results. For example, multi-modal brain imaging provides complex pictures of abnormal brain structure and function that may underlie pathophysiology such as Alz-heimer\u00e2??s disease or related dementia. There exists a urgent, unmet need in the field of clinical brain imaging for rigorous, data-driven, unbiased, computational approach to imag-ing-based biomarkers. Current dependence on parametric null hypothesis testing (e.g., t-test, ANOVA) hampers the development of computational brain imaging.\nAn overarching goal of our study is to determine novel brain imaging markers for Alz-heimer\u00e2??s disease\u00e2??using a complete data-driven machine learning approach. We will ulti-mately build a largest brain imaging database for rigorous deep and wide machine learn-ing based on tens of thousands of healthy and clinical samples. Towards this goal, in this research grant, we aim to analyze large brain imaging datasets. The first dataset includes multi-modal brain imaging from clinical cohorts (n=5,000) collected at a dementia clinic. The second dataset includes multimodal brain imaging from community-ascertained co-horts (n=20,000).\nUsing these datasets, in the first phase of the research, we will conduct computational im-aging analysis using well established, state-of-the-art imaging analysis pipelines, the core expertise of this research team (Cha, PI). This involves estimation of individual structural connectome. Then, in the second phase of the research, we will build deep neural net-work using the connectomic data to classify Alzheimer\u00e2??s disease related dementia. Im-portantly, inspired by a novel transfer learning algorithm, the deep neural network will be pre-trained on a non-clinical population-based data; the pretrained model will be then ap-plied to the clinical cohort data. This goal is based on the core expertise of this research team (Yoo, co-PI). \nIn a prior pilot data analysis, we have shown feasibility of our analytic plan. We have suc-cessfully test-run our analysis codes for brain volumetric and connectomic analysis in a subset (n=100) of the data using the allocation via the Campus Champion program. We are now ready to run the batch analysis over 10,000 individuals\u00e2?? data.\nThis research will generate unprecedented brain imaging-derived phenotypes, such as structural connectomes and brain regional morphometry from 10,000 individuals. Also, neural network models trained on these data can be applied to many classification prob-lems existing in clinical neuroimaging and cognitive neuroscience. Upon receipt of exter-nal fundings, we plan to make all the data, models, and computer programs developed in this research program publicly accessible.",

In order to use full thermal capacity of the coolant fluid used for cooling purposes, a combined approach of internal and external cooling is used. This project focuses on the external cooling side where the coolant is discharged through a slot over the surface. For accurate computations, the spatial and temporal scales have to be resolved, and Large Eddy Simulations have to be performed.

The goals of the multi-year project have been to develop improved algorithms for multiscale simulation, to test their performance while quantifying uncertainty in physicochemical mechanisms and associated parameter values, and to utilize the simulations to design improved systems. To accomplish this goal, we have examined experimental data with sensitivity analysis, parameter estimation, and model selection tools. The initial physical application chosen for study was the copper electrodeposition processes for fabricating on-chip wiring interconnections between transistors, especially the role of trace amounts of additives that are critically important. In this proposal, new PIs are added that expand the range of numerical simulation methods as well as the physical applications.  The requested computational resources are for 1,966,860 SUs on the NCSA Xeon Linux Cluster (Abe/QueenBee).

The computational effort described in this request includes deterministic as well as stochastic techniques separately and, by linking them, enables multi-scale investigations of varying electrochemical interactions and applications.\n\nWe have pursued a multi-prong approach for accelerating the stochastic algorithms and the deterministic simulations, in addition to use of parallelization. Improved algorithms and code linkages developed during 2004-06 made it possible to tackle significantly more difficult applications which, during 2007-08, were targeted on early stages of electrochemical nucleation, growth, and coalescence of metal nanoclusters and thin films on various surfaces. Such phenomena occur at time and length scales that are hundreds of times smaller than the previous applications, giving rise to issues of numerical stiffness, mesh refinement, and need for accelerated methods. In addition during 2007-08, we created a new generation of algorithms along with a new generation of systems in which simulation predictions could be compared with experimental data for parameter estimation and model validation. Throughout these successive generations of studies, the overall strategy has been to use parameter sensitivity, parameter estimation, and model discrimination techniques to select the hypothesis that most likely describes experimentally-observed phenomena. Parameter sensitivity simulations, used for both parameter estimation and model selection techniques, focus on obtaining the key fundamental parameters from large sets of experimental data. In addition to the above studies, as part of this effort, we consider other electrochemical systems such as transport (electrical and chemical transport) through synthetic nanopores and electrochemical phenomena at solid-liquid interfaces. Our multiscale method development for these applications is based on (i) hierarchical integration of quantum, atomistic, mesoscale, and classical continuum theories and (ii) quasi-continuum theories where interatomic potentials are directly integrated into the continuum theories.\n\nIn this TRAC renewal proposal, we will focus on (i) improved coarse-graining methods for accurate and rapid parameter sensitivity and parameter estimation methods for electrochemical nucleation, growth, and other applications, (ii) optimization of entire complex systems composed of previously-developed multi-scale algorithms, and (iii) application of these methods to a different electrochemical systems &#8213; lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors, synthetic ion channels, and functional surfaces. The extension to new systems will demonstrate that the algorithm and simulation developments carried out to date are also characteristic of a large class of systems where controlled shape evolution is exploited to produce desired structures. Such characteristics are ubiquitous in nanotechnology, biotechnology, and materials &#8213; where manufacturing processes must ensure quality control at the molecular scale. The algorithms and software are generic over a broad class of problems, and will contribute well beyond the applications used in their development. The availability of such computational tools will accelerate fundamental scientific research as well as engineering design.",

We wish to run these simulations using OpenFoam (an open-source CFD solver), for which user-defined functions will need to be created and compiled along with the source code. OpenFoam is highly parallelizable and scalable, so we would like to explore the feasibility of using this solver with a TACC startup allocation. We have generated approximately 30 patient-specific meshes of the aforementioned pulmonary arterial geometries.

                    "project_abstract": "One of the most difficult aspects of seismic hazard analysis is the prediction of ground motion from potential earthquakes. Accurate simulation of ground motion requires extensive knowledge of the velocity structure, source type, and site conditions in a given region; these factors must be paired with a high-resolution model mesh to predict ground motion at frequencies relevant to engineering and hazard applications. Limitations in model size and data availability often make it such that finer details in the earth model are averaged out or removed altogether, despite the fact that they could have a significant effect on predicted ground motion. In this project, we propose to examine the contribution to ground motion of an often-neglected site condition: topography. Topography has been observed to more than double earthquake ground motion in certain situations, though because of its azimuthal dependence and need for high-resolution model meshes, it is not considered in seismic hazard analysis. We will build a high-resolution mesh covering a 60km x 60km region centered on Seattle, Washington, and using the spectral element code SPECFEM3D Cartesian, run multiple rupture scenarios for Mw6.5-7.0 earthquakes on the Seattle Fault. By using high-resolution topography and a detailed 3-D velocity model, we will have an unprecedented view into the contribution of topography on seismic site response. With these tests, we will answer the question of how sensitive topographic effects are to source variability in finite fault rupture, like hypocenter location, slip distribution, and event magnitude. Paired with results from earlier tests with smaller earthquakes (Mw3.0-4.0), we will also investigate how topographic effects vary between small and large earthquakes, which have distinctly different frequency content, source distribution, and shaking duration. The results of this testing will amount to a major benchmark for the inclusion of high-resolution site conditions like topography in seismic hazard analysis.",

The theory has been mostly applied to brittle fracture; its ability to predict ductile fracture has been mostly untested. Silling et al. (2007) introduced a correspondence modeling framework for incorporating classical constitutive theories into peridynamics. Shortcomings associated with the approach, such as the unphysical problem of matter interpenetration, were reported by Tupek and Radovitzky (2014). To address the issues, they extended the original theory by incorporating non-linear bond strain measures. Recently Foster and Xu (2018) generalized Tupek\u2019s model and presented a constitutive correspondence framework with kinematic variables (e.g. a nonlocal right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor) that can be applied directly to finite deformation plasticity. Although the model is currently limited to isotropic materials, its suitability for very large deformations over the previous peridynamic models appear to outweigh the shortcoming. This Sandia Fracture Challenge provided us an opportunity to explore the new model\u2019s performance.",

The most attractive properties of tungsten for the design of magnetic and inertial fusion energy reactors are its high melting point, high thermal conductivity, low sputtering yield, and low long-term disposal radioactive footprint. However, tungsten also presents a very low fracture toughness, mostly associated with inter-granular failure and bulk plasticity, that limits its applications.  W is typically alloyed with Re to increase low-temperature ductility and improve high-temperature strength and plasticity.  Given the significant neutron-induced transmutation happening in these W-Re alloys during nuclear fusion reactions, density functional theory (DFT) calculations that allow the calculation of defect and solute energetics are critical to better understand the behavior of tungsten-based materials for fusion energy applications. The research objective of this Startup Allocation proposal is to run DFT simulations (using VAST and/or Quantum Espresso) to calculate elastic and plastic mechanical properties (such as bulk modulus, shear modulus, ductility,...) on a variety of WRe-X alloys, selecting the most relevant ones for fusion applications. \n\nWhy the project needs access to XSEDE resources?\nVillanova University became a National University in 2016. To consolidate this transition, university leadership is encouraging junior faculty to initiate strong research programs. However, the high-performance computing facilities required to perform research in computational mechanics are still very limited on campus. The DFT calculations required to achieve the goals described in the previous sections are computationally intensive, and far beyond what can be done with the small cluster currently available on campus.\n\nHow the requested amounts were estimated?\nThe requested amounts were estimated using preliminary simulations run in a cluster with 80 cores available on campus, which has QE installed.  A total of 980 hours were required to complete all the calculations for single crystal tungsten. Then a total of 50,000 CPU-hours on Bridges and Comet and 1,600 node-hours on STampede2 were requested to allow us the most flexibility when testing 50 tentative WRe-X alloys that are subject of this study.\n\nWhy the requested resources were selected?\nAn email was sent to help@xsede.org on June 26, 2019 asking about the most suitable resource for the nature of the project. Based on the response received, Bridges, Comet, and Stampede2 were selected.",

Improvements in HPLC column efficiency have been \ndriven by reductions in particle size. Non-spherical, superficially porous particles (SPP) are a possibility for improving separation efficiency without further reducing the particle length scale. This research will investigate the chromatographic efficiency of ellipsoidal and spherocylindrical particles in HPLC, using pore-scale simulation methods capable of resolving flow and transport in microporous SPP.  The methods include computer algorithms for three-dimensional particle packing, viscous flow through the pore spaces of the packing, and time-dependent hydrodynamic dispersion of solutes in the flowing solvent. The methods will be applied within a general experimental design that will consider the parameters of particle shape, superficial porosity, particle orientation with respect to flow, packing volume fraction, and applied pressure drop, focusing on parameter value ranges of likely industrial significance. The experimental outcomes of broadest \nsignificance include the chromatographic efficiency (plate height vs velocity) and impedence (plate height vs pressure drop).",
