                    "project_abstract": "Magnetised turbulence plays a significant role in a variety of astrophysical and laboratory processes, ranging from the generation of large-scale magnetic fields in stellar interiors, to the transport of angular momentum in accretion discs and heating in the solar corona. Unfortunately, despite its wide-ranging applicability, magnetised turbulence has evaded a general physical understanding for many decades. The development of a firm theoretical foundation for magnetised turbulence remains one of the most important outstanding problems in astrophysics.\n\nThe development of the theory for magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence heavily relies on massively parallel numerical computations. The enormous increase in computational power over recent years has enabled high-resolution numerical simulations that have led to the discovery of an array of important new effects and a number of thought-provoking theoretical conjectures have been put forward. In particular, in the case of strong field-guided incompressible MHD turbulence it has been found that the turbulent domain spontaneously fragments into regions in which the velocity and magnetic fields are aligned within a small scale-dependent angle. The aligned structures have a number of important consequences, particularly on the efficiency of the energy cascade. Moreover, it has recently become apparent that our ability to measure the scale-dependence of the alignment angle, even at low Reynolds number where traditionally only a very short inertial range is detectable (thus making the identification of scaling laws difficult), may have uncovered a new result that could be related to a well-known phenomenon in isotropic hydrodynamic turbulence. The phenomenon is known as extended self-similarity, which refers to the empirical result that the universal region of self-similarity can be significantly extended if one plots a structure function versus a second structure function for which an exact expression is known, rather than naively plotting the structure function versus the increment. If this result can be extended to the anisotropic case of magnetised turbulence its implications will be widespread, as it will enable scaling laws to be determined from a statistical analysis of numerical or observational data sets of a much reduced resolution than would otherwise be necessary.\n\nThe aim is to investigate the phenomenon of extended self-similarity in the inertial range dynamics of strong incompressible MHD turbulence. We propose a series of high-resolution numerical simulations that will elucidate the character of this mechanism. The simulations will provide crucial information for developing a comprehensive phenomenological model of strong MHD\nturbulence and will provide a useful tool for inferring the scaling properties of MHD turbulence from astrophysical observations.",

However, the microscopic QED processes in this case are inherently entwined with the full complexity of a macroscopic laser-plasma interaction and neither may be considered in isolation. Therefore, the standard particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation approach is inadequate for describing QED-plasmas and a new approach must be adopted. We plan to study QED-plasmas using an adaptive parallel numerical simulation code PSC suitable for simulating strong field QED processes in mean field approximation.\n\nWe plan to perform simulations of intense laser radiation interacting with foils.

Spectral control of the surface emissivity is essential in applications pertaining to concentrated solar thermal (CST) systems and solar thermophotovoltaic (STPV) systems because it enables higher conversion efficiency of solar light into infrared photons that can be harvested with almost 100% efficiency and converted into electricity.",

Though a great number of methods has been developed, the access to those is restricted to the theoretical groups involved or the code is rather complex and require an important experience from the user community. Among all, the most successful algorithm which treats the dynamical correlations accurately is the combination of dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and density functional theory (DFT). However, in the present research, we plan to develop a computational package that will allow electronic structure and lattice dynamic calculations with a minimal set of parameters, by o\u00ef\u00ac?ering to the end user the possibility of using di\u00ef\u00ac?erent methodologies to describe basic physics of SCM. To achieve this goal, we request computing time on XSEDE resources for development and application of methodologies for strongly correlated systems. This project is funded by the national science foundation (NSF), grant 1740112. We are planning to calculate the electronic, magnetic, optical, elastic, and vibrational properties of SCM, which can be easily compared with the experimental results.

These magnetic fields are sustained through the motion of electrically conducting fluids within their interiors via the so-called dynamo mechanism, which converts the kinetic energy of fluid motion into electromagnetic energy. Understanding the physics of these systems remains a challenging task due to the extreme physical parameters that characterize these systems. For instance, natural dynamos are typically dominated by two or more forces; the remaining forces are relatively small and play a very subtle role that remains poorly understood. Moreover, rotation and magnetic fields introduce inhomogeneity and anisotropy into the flow field and a general understanding of their influence on the statistics of turbulence is lacking. This proposal seeks to overcome this limitation by performing one of the most detailed investigations to date of convection-driven magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, with a particular focus on understanding how magnetic waves influence the dynamics.

This proposal is based on two main projects that have been previously approved and funded by NSF: Project A. Quantum Materials from geometric and dimensionality design, reviewed and accepted by NSF-DMR, project date June 15, 2018 \u00e2?? May 31, 2021, award number: 1724791; Project B. Predictive theory, synthesis and characterization of a new type of transparent conductor without doping, reviewed and accepted by NSF-DMR, project date July 1, 2018 \u00e2?? June 30, 2021, award number: 1806939. In project A, we propose to build upon our recent successful preliminary work on geometric and dimensionality design to obtain Quantum Materials with emergent properties that greatly supersede or are even qualitatively absent from those attainable from the individual compound building blocks. The main \u00e2??knobs\u00e2?? involve a search for specific superstructure patterns (A)n/(B)m/(A)p/(B)n\u00e2??/\u00e2?\u00a6 (where n, m, p, n\u00e2??... are the repeat periods of the building blocks compounds A, B), or polymorphs with specifically reduced symmetries that deliver unusual, emergent quantum properties. In project B, we realize that the current method of choice for discovering new transparent conductors have relied on heavily doping transparent insulators until they become conducting, while unfortunately, wide gap materials are intrinsically resistant to doping of charges because of the existence of \u00e2??doping bottlenecks\u00e2??, thus consequently, the progress in finding and optimizing such technologically critical transparent conducting oxide materials has been frustratingly slow. We propose an opposite, and likely more fruitful alternative of designing transparency in metals by looking for compounds that obey a set of \u00e2??design principles\u00e2?\u009d with specific band structures. The design rules for our proposed intrinsic transparent conductors are: (i) identify a compound with metallic band structure; such that (ii) it has low plasma frequency and (iii) low inter-band optical absorption across the Fermi level, and (iv) apply synthesis and characterization to the \u00e2??best of class\u00e2?\u009d compounds. The most visible advantage of metallic transparent conductors is that their conductivity comes from their high, indigenous carrier concentration. Such rare compounds could not have been identified by chance, and currently require a trial-and-error Edisonian method.",

It is well known that certain geometrical modifications to aircraft engines can reduce their radiated noise.  However, there is no manner to predict which modifications will actually reduce the noise, resulting in lengthy---and costly---experimental programs to parametrically study candidate design modifications.  This deficiency is due to the conceptual, experimental, and computational challenges associated with turbulence-generated sound and, hence, in developing effective control methods.  By solving the compressible Navier-Stokes equations directly, this research provides foundational descriptions of the sound-generating fluid motions and subsequent development of optimized control methodologies.

A novel numerical technique based on combination of a particle-based method and standard continuum approach will be developed to study interfacial phenomena of inception, growth and bursting of vapor bubbles, breakup and coalescence of liquid droplets, and interactions of the fluid surface with complex solid boundaries encountered in cooling of electronic devices, hydro-mechanics of propulsion systems, and cavitation.\n\nNumerical modeling of these flow features using traditional mesh-based finite-volume schemes necessitates use of a time-varying adaptive grid to capture the wide range of length and time scales. The increased complexity and associated costs related to the topological changes in the computational grid are absent in the pure mesh-free techniques. However, they suffer from issues related to efficient implementation of advanced multi-physics models. The hybrid computational approach merges the locally `adaptive' nature of the mesh-free approach for interface tracking with the relative `ease' of the Eulerian finite-volume formulation for complex configurations providing an efficient and accurate numerical technique. \n\nThe proposed developments will be performed in an existing unstructured grid finite-volume solver capable of performing large-scale computations of turbulent flows in complex configurations.\nThis solver was developed under the Department of Energy's Advanced Scientific Computing (ASC) program at Stanford University. %The PI was part of this program from 2000-2005 and has demonstrated high efficiency and speedup of the solver. \nThe basic algorithm will be further developed to address simulations of turbulent flows at high Reynolds numbers. A number of verification and validation studies on motion of single and multiple particles in turbulent flows is planned. Once completed, this formulation will be used to study particle-turbulence interactions using direct numerical simulation. Interactions of micro-bubbles with turbulent boundary layers is important for drag reduction,  whereas studying motion of solid particles in turbulent channels is necessary to understand the sediment transport process and their effect on landform changes and impact on shipping routes. \n\nThe emphasis of this work will be on generating and analyzing a data set for particle-turbulence interactions to understand the multiscale energy cascade mechanisms. The potential impact of this work will be in the fundamental understanding of two-phase flows and interfacial phenomena in complex environments where it is difficult to obtain detailed experimental data.  This will be a major step forward in large-scale computations of multi-physics turbulent flows.

The studies planned for the upcoming year will focus on development of practical skin-friction drag reduction technologies for transportation inspired by the mechanisms observed in polymer drag reduction. A cornerstone of these studies is some recent preliminary DNS studies performed in our lab which show that in turbulent channel flow, MDR conditions can be achieved with the polymer force activated only in the viscous sub-layer and the buffer layer. This observation opens up new possibilities for developing practical drag reduction technologies for use in transportation. The simulations planned for the upcoming year will include: (i) more detailed simulations of turbulent channel flow with the polymer force activated only in the viscous sub-layer and the buffer layer; (ii) simulations of turbulent channel flow with a sharp viscosity gradient imposed in the viscous sub-layer and the buffer layer; (iii) simulations of turbulent channel flow with a wire mesh in the viscous sub-layer and the buffer layer; and (iv) simulations of turbulent channel flow with flexible fibers in the viscous sub-layer and the buffer layer. The principle action of all these drag reduction technologies is to redirect a small portion of turbulence kinetic energy at the location of the peak of turbulence production in the buffer layer into a path other than the normal turbulent energy cascade. This re-routing of the turbulence kinetic energy at a given turbulent scale results in a drop in the fluctuating strain rate at that scale which, in turn, inhibits the ability of turbulence to redistribute the kinetic energy at that scale from the streamwise to the cross-stream directions through the pressure-strain term.  This results in a pileup of kinetic energy in the streamwise direction and a drop of kinetic energy in the cross-stream directions, which leads to an overall drop in the Reynolds shear-stress and a concomitant drop turbulence production, thus leading to turbulence suppression and drag reduction. These are the principle mechanisms at work in drag reduction by dilute polymer solutions. A total of 400,000 SUs is requested for these studies. Because the IU BigRed will be decommissioned from Teragrid service in March 2010, the requested allocation is split between IU, which we plan to use up to March 2010, and TACC Ranger which we plan to use thereafter. The requested tape storage at SDSC HPSS is for existing data which we have stored at this facility over the past seven years.\n",

The thesis of the current research is that transformative ideas in modeling, computation and analysis of cardiac blood flows and associated heart sound can enable highly effective and inexpensive simulation-guided therapies and diagnostic tools for heart diseases in the not-too-distant future. Understanding cardiac flows, especially inside the left ventricle, is an essential first step to diagnosing and treating several heart related diseases. Numerous efforts have been made in analyzing cardiac flows over the past two decades through in-vitro (e.g., laboratory PIV measurements), in-vivo (e.g., phase contrast MRI) experiments and computational methods. Though medical imaging techniques such as phase contrast MRI, CT, etc., provide details about the anatomy and some gross features of the flow, not much insight related to complex fluid behavior can be obtained using these approaches. Most of the computational and laboratory (in-vitro) studies have employed simplified geometries while attempting to match physiological values in terms of key hemodynamic parameters, and ignored pivotal interactions between heart flexible tissues, especially heart valves, and complex flow patterns inside heart chambers. The long-term goal of the current project is to develop image-based, biophysically-detailed, multi-scale, multi-physics models of the ventricular blood flows in health and disease that run efficiently on large-scale, CPU/GPU clusters, and to use these models to understand the biophysics of cardiac dysfunction. In this year, we will i) validate the computational modeling of cardiac flow against the in-vivo MRI measurements, ii) investigate the effect of structural dynamics of heart valve and its interaction with hemodynamics, and iii) biochemical process on the development of heart diseases.",

The computational research that is the topic of the present proposal focuses on performing simulations that will contribute to the understanding of the uncertainty related to the use of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence and turbulent heat transfer models by using high-fidelity data sets obtained from large-eddy simulations (LES). The requested computational resources will be used to perform LES simulations required to generate data sets for two different applications of interest to the PIs research group: flow and pollutant dispersion in urban environments and heat transfer. \nIn the context of pollutant dispersion we propose to perform LES of the flow and dispersion in downtown Oklahoma City. We previously published a turbulence model form uncertainty quantification study for RANS simulations of this geometry, showing very promising results. The availability of high-fidelity LES data has the potential to significantly increase the impact of this study, since the data will support a detailed investigation and validation of the methodology. The LES simulation results will demonstrate whether the turbulence model form uncertainty quantification method does effectively provide realistic bounds for the prediction of the flow field, and will also be used to guide further development of the method. \nThe LES simulations with heat transfer will consider realistic heat exchanger geometries to obtain a high-fidelity data base of the Reynolds stresses and the turbulent heat fluxes. This database will be used to establish and validate a novel methodology to quantify uncertainty in turbulent heat flux models. The results will be analyzed to address two main questions, similar to those previously considered for development of the Reynolds stress model uncertainty quantification method: 1) define a marker that indicates in which regions of the flow the turbulent heat flux model plausibly fails and 2) define perturbations of the turbulent heat fluxes that result in the prediction of realistic upper and lower uncertainty bounds for the temperature field.",

As part of our continuing investigations into the fundamental mechanics of complex fluid flows using numerical simulations, we request 4.95M SU on Kraken and 3.01M SU on the Gordon Compute Cluster, as well as 158.52 TB of disk space. Using Kraken resources, we propose to investigate the multiscale physics of droplet breakup for multiphase nozzle flow applications. In full three-dimensional simulations solving the Navier-Stokes equations, parametric studies will examine the effects of post-shock Mach number and viscosity on the droplet breakup process. The resources on the Gordon Compute Cluster will be used to study three-dimensional instabilities and vortical structures in complex wake flows. Using a novel immersed boundary method based on lattice Green's functions, we propose direct numerical simulations of separated flows at Reynolds numbers ranging from 1,000 to 50,000.",

                    "project_abstract": "In the United States, about two-thirds of conventional crude oil in mature fields remains unproduced because of the physics of fluid flow.  At the pore scale, chemical enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is an advanced technique to overcome the physical forces holding hydrocarbons and to increase production. Conventional oil recovery approach often involves water injection into the underground reservoir to remove the oil drop from the pore. The challenge is that strong interfacial tension (small capillary number) always prevents oil drops from squeezing through complex geological microstructures. On the one hand, surfactant flooding is an effective approach by drastically decreasing surface tension. On the other hand, Marangoni stress may impede the motion of oil drops through the pore. To date, dynamic distribution of surfactant micelles interacting with oil drops in pore constrictions remains an open question, which impacts the design principals of flow pressure, surfactant blends and complex microstructure. Fundamental understanding of these very complex processes is impossible without rigorous pore-scale modeling. In this work, we study the surfactant effect on the deformable drop motion between two particles, a well-defined model for an emulsion in the granular porous material. We propose to solve this prototype problem by performing 3D direct numerical simulation, where the front-tracking method tracks the droplet motion, and the distributed Lagrangian multiplier approach resolves the interactions between flow and solid surfaces. The 3D numerical solver is Ardekani\u00e2??s in-house Fortran code, parallel with MPI using the domain decomposition approach. Initial tests with an allocation from the XSEDE Campus Champions program have shown the high parallel efficiency of MPI on Stampede2 (TACC) and Bridges (PSC). This startup proposal is to request 1,600 node-hours (Stampede2) and 50,000 (core-hours) for acquisition of preliminary results and further benchmarking of the computational cost/scaling of the in-house solver. The requested XSEDE allocations are necessary for our large-scale multi-drop/multi-particle simulations, which is beyond the tractable computational capabilities of our local resources.",

The allocation will support the group of\nthe principal investigator (PI), Prof. Eckart Meiburg, to investigate transport processes involving\nstrongly coupled fluid and particle phases. The interactions between the two phases play a crucial\nrole in a number of research areas, several among them at the center of petroleum science. Prime\nexamples concern hydraulic fracturing processes, in which a complex fluid containing small particles\nis injected into hydraulically opened rock fractures, or sediment transport within the context of\ndeep-sea hydrocarbon exploration, which aims to identify large-scale sediment deposits containing\noil and gas reservoirs. In order to advance our fundamental understanding of the grain-scale\nprocesses underlying the large-scale dynamics of such particulate flows, the PI has initiated a new\nresearch direction aimed at performing three-dimensional, high-resolution and massively parallel\ngrain-resolving simulations of concentrated particulate suspensions. The availability of such a\nsimulation tool will allow the PIs group to initiate a multitude of new research avenues, ranging\nfrom the optimization of oil/sand separation processes to the dynamics of marine snow, which forms\nthe basis of several geo-engineering concepts proposed for deep-ocean CO2-sequestration.\nThe present project will explore the interaction of particle-laden flows and sediment beds at the\nmicroscopic scale of individual grains via grain-resolving simulations. One goal is the development\nof accurate models for their erosional and depositional behavior, which can then be incorporated\ninto existing macroscopic simulation codes. This will enable the PIs group to analyze multi-\nscale, realistic systems involving large numbers of individual, interacting particles.",

Computational challenges associated with reliable analysis include accurate representation of the multiscale flow patterns and turbulence, accurate representation of the turbine geometry, and accurate representation of the rotational motion. The key components of the computational technology we developed to address these challenges include the ST variational multiscale (ST-VMS) method [1] and the ST isogeometric analysis (ST-IGA) [2]. The ST-VMS method has superior spatial and temporal accuracy in representing the flow field, geometry and motion.  The ST-IGA further increases this accuracy, in both space and time.\n\nAccurate flow analysis of a turbocharger turbine for a given set of design parameters requires 0.5-4.0 million computational points in space, with 5 unknowns for each point, and about 2000 time steps of computation. The ST representation at least doubles the number of unknowns at each computational point in space, and triples if higher-order temporal basis functions are used. At each time step, we solve a coupled nonlinear equation system with tens of millions of unknowns. Computations of this magnitude cannot be done without efficient parallel computing, requiring parallel computing platforms with thousands of cores or hundreds of thousands of threads. The ST methods achieve increased accuracy by increasing the number of unknowns for each computational point in space, rather than by increasing the number of time steps. This way of increasing the accuracy is very suitable for parallel efficiency because it allows using larger number of threads. The ST-IGA method achieves increased accuracy by increasing the number of operations per unknown, rather than by increasing the number of unknowns. This way of increasing the accuracy is also very suitable for parallel efficiency, because it decreases the share of the communication cost.\n\n[1] K. Takizawa and T.E.

In the proposed simulations, we will apply computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to model the three-dimensional aerodynamics and aeroelasticity of the deformable insect wing and to evaluate the comprehensive role of the structural flexibility in the wing's aerodynamic performance.  The numerical method couples an immersed-boundary method for the flow solver and a finite-element method for the structural solver.  The specific studies include the following three model configurations: (1) a flapping/pitching plate in hovering flight, (2) a pitching plate in a uniform freestream, and (3) a dragonfly wing model with the simplified vein structure.  The code has been developed and tested on the previous Lonestar and other clusters.

Several active transporters that use various source of energy in a living cell for their function will be investigated. Furthermore, we will also continue our research on another membrane associated phenomenon, namely mechanism of membrane binding and activation of blood coagulation factors, which constitutes the most productive project over the past funding period, and a strong collaborative effort between 5 labs at UIUC.  In fact, all of the projects are conducted in close collaboration with leading experimental groups.   All Projects address rather slow processes, thus, requiring long simulations. Furthermore, due to the need of explicit representation of the lipid and water, which play role in the mechanism of transporters, and due to the complexity of the structure, large molecular assemblies need to be simulated. Such calculations can only be carried out with the advanced TeraGrid computational resources. The size and\ncomplexity of the function of these proteins pose a great challenge for computational studies. Over the last funding period, however, we have demonstrated through several published papers reported in the Progress Report, that large scale MD simulations can indeed significantly advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of energy coupling and transport phenomena in these biomolecules. Due to limited space and the need to describe 6 projects, we have delegated the progress and discussion of our preliminary results\ncompletely to the Progress Report. Our extensive use of the allocation over the past funding period is the strongest evidence for the computational demands of such biomolecular systems. We note, however, that we have used the allocated time extremely productively and produced a record number of publications (16; please see Progress Report) over the past funding cycle. We would like to give a general clarification with regard to the length of the proposed simulations, which might be perceived as an \"unjustified\" aspect. All of the projects address rather slow biomolecular processes (at least on the\norder of microsecond). As such, even orders of magnitude longer simulations than those described in this application\ncan be easily justified from a technical point of view. However, we realize that such processes (e.g., complete transport cycle) cannot be currently described in their entirety, and we can only expect to cover some of the steps involved in such processes. Therefore, in order to provide a justification that will hopefully\nbe satisfactory, almost in all cases we will base the length of the proposed simulations on our existing benchmarks (mostly published) of the same or comparable systems/phenomena. \n\n",

Kir channels should adopt several different functional states depending on differential regulatory lipid binding as well as pore blocker binding. Although a few Kir channel crystal structures have been determined4-9, the three-dimensional structures in each functional state are yet to be elucidated and dynamic properties of the channels is almost absent, which limits our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of channel function and hence the opportunities to develop small molecules to access specific states. We aim to fill up these holes in our knowledge of Kir channel gating through combining experimental approaches (x-ray crystallography, single particle-EM, single molecule FRET, in vitro functional assays, and electrophysiology) and computational modeling (docking and molecular dynamics simulations), which will advance our knowledge of how these channels undergo various conformations as well as dynamic states throughout their functional cycles.",

Research conducted as part of this proposal will enable molecular-level understanding of the natural routes for cellulose conversion to sugar, thus facilitating rational design approaches for improved biofuels processes at the industrial scale.  Three groups of projects will be pursued concurrently:  1) modeling of the plant cell wall structure from the atomistic to the micrometer length scale with a multiscale simulation approach; 2) investigation of fungal cellulases interacting with cellulose; and 3) a study of bacterial enzymes that assemble to form huge protein complexes (cellulosomes) to degrade cellulose synergistically.",

Vibrational probe groups in proteins provide data in which the structural ensemble is in slow exchange and directly appears in the lineshape, unlike most other protein analytical techniques.  We have recently cemented an approach that can provide quantitatively interpretability from vibrational probe lineshapes and directly link those lineshapes to physical and structural changes in the protein.  This computational allocation will be used to predict structural ensembles (through replica exchange simulations), to run short trajectories on submembers of those ensembles with the probe groups included, and to calculate the vibrational frequencies throughout the MD trajectories to provide lineshapes which could connect our extensive experimental data to dynamic structural ensembles. Constituting such a connection would be highly significant for many different proteins; this allocation will focus on three proteins: calmodulin (our test system), viral replicative complexes from the Hendra and Nipah viruses, and acyl carrier proteins.",

As part of our broader effort toward developing effective anti-cancer therapeutics by directly targeting Ras, we propose to conduct large-scale molecular dynamics simulations to study the structure, dynamics and druggability of Ras monomers and oligomers in solution and membrane environments. We will also investigate the roles of trans-membrane length, palmitoylation and amino acid sequence in determining membrane domain preferences and dimerization of LAT.",

Numerical relativity has truly become a tool of discovery. For gravitational wave astrophysics, it has enabled a serious conversation between researchers modeling sources of gravitational radiation and scientists focussed on the intricacies of analyzing the\ndata collected by interferometric detectors.  The black hole binaries continues to be one of the most transformative challenges at the interface of gravitational wave physics, astrophysics, mathematical relativity and computational\nscience. The challenge resides in the complexities associated with solving Einstein's equations; in the many scales involved, from those comparable to the binary orbits or gravitational wavelengths to those in the vicinity of the black holes; in the resolutions needed to accurately extract gravitational waveforms; and in the inclusion of physics to model matter sources. \nThe allocation requested will support  work on  binary  black holes systems organized in the following closely related project areas: 1) Binary black holes in vacuum to expand parameter space explored to include arbitrary black hole spin orientations and to enhance a bank of  hybrid gravitational waveforms.\n2) Binary black holes in astrophysical environments to investigate whether electromagnetic observations are able to detect and characterize the presence of these binary systems. \n3)Binary black holes in alternative theories of gravity to study the late inspiral and merger of a binary coalescences and distinguish between scalar-tensor gravity and general relativity.\n",

GW170817 was also observed across the electromagnetic\nspectrum by over 70 observatories. These breakthroughs ushered in the era of gravitational wave and multimessenger astronomy, allowing us to probe gravity and matter in unprecedented regimes. Robust, first-principles theoretical modeling of multimessenger sources is necessary both to build templates for detecting gravitational wave signals in upcoming observations, and for the interpretation of existing and future multimessenger signals. Such modeling requires supercomputer simulations of gravitational wave sources by solving the Einstein equations coupled to matter, electromagnetic fields and radiation. Several groups are performing such simulations focusing on subsets of the vast parameter space of compact binaries that must be explored to achieve complete understanding of the problem; our group has substantial expertise studying compact binary mergers, circumbinary accretion onto binary black holes, and the nuclear equation of state. The simulations proposed here will advance the state-of-the-art on all these fronts. In particular, we propose to perform the first systematic studies of the effects of realistic, finite temperature component of the nuclear equation of state in binary neutron star mergers, and the impact of black hole spin in magnetized accretion disks onto binary black holes.",

In the case of PT, the interaction of the proton with the biomolecular environment is represented by the multi-state empirical valence bond (MS-EVB) method, and the potential of mean force (PMF) along the pathway of PT is calculated by averaging over highly parallel swarms of trajectories. A novel methodology to simulate multiple protons, based on the MS-EVB, has just been developed by our group and scales nearly linearly with proton number. Large atomistic simulations of biological assemblies will be performed in order to systematically parameterize coarse-grained mesoscopic models that will be employed to examine long time- and length-scale phenomena. Multi-scale coupled simulations of embedded proteins in lipid bilayers, as well as spectrin filaments will be employed to directly examine atomistic-level couplings with mesoscopic phenomena.

While they share many characteristics and properties with ionic liquids, they usually consist of ionic salt and hydrogen bond donor (HBD). DESs show eutectic phase behavior, which stands for remarkably lower melting temperature compared to the original component materials. This feature enables DESs to be very useful chemical solvents with diversity of molecular design, especially in polymer synthesis. Polymer solutions can show temperature dependent phase behavior of mixing and de-mixing. However, the microscopic physical origin of such phase behaviors of polymer in DES is not systematically understood. Polymers in DESs can be accurately modeled by symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) which provides physically-motivated ab-initio force field with polarizable model. Therefore, we will evaluate the polarizable SAPT force fields of polymer/DESs by obtaining phase equilibria of polymer/DESs. We are going to develop a framework of ML for phase equilibria with simple models and we will utilize ML techniques with MD simulation for polymer/DESs.",

A direct simulation of atomic motion is limited to picoseconds when the forces and energies are based upon density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The relevant timescale for the function of batteries and fuel cells, however, are on a human timescale of second to minutes. In this proposal we will develop the adaptive kinetic Monte Carlo method for use with DFT codes to model novel materials that can function as electrolytes and electrodes in Li batteries and solid oxide fuel cells which can accelerate and select reactions of interest. The parallel resources offered by the XSEDE program will allow us to explore the potential energy surface around stable states and determine the mechanism and rates of possible reaction mechanisms. We have, and will continue over the duration of this project, to develop the EON code which manages the individual calculations that identify saddle points on the potential landscape which correspond to each possible reaction mechanism and collects the information to evolve the system over timescales set by the elementary reaction mechanisms. Importantly, this methodology does not require intuition from the user so that reaction pathways are determined automatically and can be surprising and complex, if that is the nature of the potential energy landscape. We show, in this proposal, that we will be able to efficiently use the XSEDE resources for these calculations. This project will also enable us to accomplish the goals set out in our NSF funded projects to improve the efficiency of our computational methods as well as model intercalation and diffusion in battery materials and the chemistry at catalytic surfaces.",

However, due to their poor scaling, these ab initio methods are often intractable for even moderately sized physical systems when high levels of theory are utilized. Thus, large-scale computational resources are needed in order to provide accurate descriptions and meaningful predictions using quantum mechanical methods. Additionally, in some cases, innovative computational strategies must be developed and implemented to overcome the scaling and sampling limitations. In the current proposal, we describe two computational projects using ab initio quantum mechanical methods and novel methodologies aimed at understanding complex chemical phenomena, including the interactions between carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons in the condensed phase, and the selective extraction of lanthanide metals using organic chelators.",

                    "project_abstract": "The human voltage gated potassium channel Kv11.1 encoded by the hERG gene is the key repolarizing K+ current in cardiomyocytes.  Many drugs are known to block IKr, which can lead to an acquired long QT syndrome, the standard clinical ECG-based indicator for an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias such as Tosades de Pointes (TdP). In fact, hERG block is a common side effect for drugs and drug candidates, leading to their withdrawal from the market. However, hERG blockers have very different proclivities for arrhythmogenesis and thus cardiac safety profiles. We hypothesize that the fundamental mode of drug interaction, derived from the unique structure activity relationship of a drug, determines the resultant effects on cardiac electrical activity in cells and tissue. In addition, female sex has been shown to be an independent risk factor for an acquired LQTS and TdP, and while our recent work has shown that drugs and estrogen can coexist in the hERG pore, the molecular mechanisms of these interactions and their effects remain unknown. Multiple unbiased and restrained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on XSEDE CPU and GPU resources reaching tens of microseconds in total are ideally suited to explore atomic-scale basis of these effects. Now is also the best time for these studies since high-resolution cryo-EM structures of an open state hERG and a closed state of a homologous rEAG channels have recently become available. We have already begun testing hERG open state stability through long unbiased MD simulations using our local resources and an active DE Shaw Anton 2 allocation. Also, we have been working on homology models of hERG inactivated state through structural modeling with ROSETTA supported by electrophysiological measurements on mutant channels by our experimental collaborators. Multiple MD simulations will be crucially important for the validation of those models by considering different applied voltages, as well as channel mutants that are known to preferentially stabilize hERG in distinct conformational states. Accurate empirical force field parameters for several cardiac-safe and pro-arrhythmic hERG-blocking drugs have been developed in our laboratory as well using both local resources and a startup XSEDE allocation on Comet at SDSC.  We will be validating those parameters and computing drug membrane partitioning thermodynamics and permeation rates using umbrella sampling MD simulations for drug/hydrated lipid membrane systems. This information will be used to perform multi-microsecond drug and hormone \u00e2??flooding\u00e2?\u009d unbiased and umbrella sampling all-atom MD simulations with hERG in distinct conformational states. We will also investigate the effects of drug ionization states as well as applied voltage, which can all modulate drug binding affinities and thus their pro-arrhythmia proclivities in hope to obtain an accurate molecular picture of channel state-dependent drug binding and egress pathways along with corresponding energetics.  This information will allow us to predict pro-arrhythmia determinants at the molecular level and will help to develop new pharmaceuticals with improved cardiac safety profiles.",

The research we plan to perform, which is funded by NIH grant GM30580 to RML, addresses forefront biophysical issues concerning basic mechanisms of molecular recognition in biological systems. The software infrastructure we propose to employ is optimized through parallelism at various levels of the calculation and can make efficient use of the hardware configuration of the AQSL Teragrid clusters.

However, still some types of ions can permeate directly from that depending on the type and composition of the membrane.\nThe mechanism of this passive permeation of ions is still under debate and some aspects of it is unknown. For positively charged ions, like potassium, the interaction with the charged phosphate head groups plays an important role in the permeation. Computer simulation are one of the powerful tools to shed light on this phenomenon.\n\nIn this project, a new set of reaction coordinates will be introduced to consider the interaction of the potassium ion with phosphate groups. The complete pathway of the permeation will be found in the space of these new reaction coordinates by means of a well-known method called Milestoning in which the thermodynamics and kinetics of this permeation will be obtained. The results will be compared to the available experimental data. \n\nThis start up project will be done on potassium. This allocation will be helpful to understand and test these set of reaction coordinate for a research plan for different types of ions with different charges and sizes which we expect to submit later as a research allocation project.\n\nFor this study NAMD software will be used which is available on Lonestar 5.\n\nWe need to cover a region of 35*35 Angstroms with resolution of 1 Angstrom to find the thermodynamics and kinetics of this permeation. To achieve our goal we need to set up 35*35=1225 short simulations of 0.5 nanosecond each. This is equivalent to ~0.6 microseconds in total. The benchmarks obtained for a similar system to be approximately 14-15ns/day  on Lonestar 5 if we use 2 node/day (48SU). So the whole project can be performed with a 2100SU startup project on Lonestar5.\n\nAll the analysis will be performed on the local computers after moving the files.\nThe result is expected to be published in a peer reviewed journal.",

In this proposal, we request for TeraGrid computational facilities to approach cellular mechanotransduction from a computational viewpoint and shed light on two important sub-cellular phenomena in which the role of mechanical factors are decisive: focal adhesion formation and nucleocytoplasmic transport. Individual molecules are suggested to be molecular mechanosensors at focal adhesions. These molecules alter their binding activity upon exposure to external force. We will investigate the validity of this suggestion and evaluate the mechanisms by which single molecules at focal adhesions could act as molecular mechanosensors. \nWhile our main focus in this proposal will be investigation of focal adhesion formation, we also aim to shed light on nucleocytoplasmic transport across the nuclear pore complex (NPC) using two different approaches: (1) all atomic simulations and (2) coarse-grained modeling. It is suggested that NPC tpr proteins interact with transport factors crm1 and importin-&#946;/&#945; to facilitate the cargo-complex translocation across the NPC. The alleged hydrophobic binding sites, however, are not determined yet. We suggest a thorough molecular dynamic simulation to find those sites. Results from this project could reveal possible mechanisms for facilitated transport. Taking into account the results of all-atomic simulations, we also will develop a coarse-grained model of the whole structure of the NPC to provide a big picture of nucleocytoplasmic transport and find out the specific role of some important factors in active transport, such as FG-repeat density in the pore, active cargo-FG hydrophobic binding affinity, aspect ratio of active cargo, and existing of competing factors within the pore for FG-repeat binding sites. The 9,900,000 SUs we are requesting will let us proceed with these projects and reveal important aspects of each of them at different scales. \n",

For this we will explore the phenomenological consequences of two qualitatively different classes of solutions: self-interacting dark matter and stellar feedback. Our work will contribute to our understanding on how baryons transform the central structure of dark matter halos, how self-interacting dark matter affects galaxy formation, and what are the resulting central densities of dark matter halos when self-interacting dark matter acts together with baryonic processes. We will provide the best constraints available on how strong can dark matter self-interact, and demonstrate if SIDM is a viable solution to the small scale problems that challenge our standard CDM paradigm.",

The EOR is one of the last unexplored \nwindows of cosmic time subject to direct observation, and a \ncrucial missing link in our astronomical confirmation of the \ncurrent standard theory of cosmology, the Cold Dark Matter \n(\"CDM\") model. Towards that end, we have pioneered the \nlarge-scale numerical simulation of this phenomenon, to \npredict a host of observable consequences with which to \ntest the theory, ranging from the redshifted cosmic \n21cm background from hydrogen atoms in the neutral zones \nduring the EOR, to the angular fluctuations of the \ncosmic microwave background introduced when those photons \nscatter off free electrons in the ionized zones, to the \nquenching of light from the earliest galaxies when their \nLyman alpha emission lines resonantly scatter off the trace of \nneutral atoms left behind inside the ionized zones. EOR \nsimulations involve two ingredients: (1) gravitational N-body \nsimulation of large-scale structure formation in a volume \nlarge enough to provide a fair sample of the universe and \nthe geometry of its patchy ionization, with a large enough \nparticle number to resolve the formation of all the galactic \nhalos that are important sources of reionization photons; and \n(2) a separate simulation to transport the ionizing radiation \nreleased by all those galactic sources, until the ionized \npatches created by these galaxies eventually grow to overlap. \nThe N-body simulation provides the underlying gas density \nfield of the IGM into which that radiation propagates, \nand identifies all the galactic halos that form over \ntime to supply the reionization photons. The radiative transfer \nsimulation performs ray-tracing from each source while \nsolving the nonequilibrium ionization balance rate equations \nat each point in space, to determine the opacity. We have \nrecently developed two, new, massively- parallel methods for \nthese two ingredients, more powerful than those we previously \nused to simulate cosmic reionization, and we propose here to \nuse them to advance the study of this subject to a new level, \nby utilizing the capabilities of the new Sun Constellation \ncluster at TACC (Ranger). For the N-body simulation, we will \nemploy our new CUBEP3M method, a newly parallelized version \nof the Particle-Particle/Particle-Mesh code, to perform an \nunprecedented, extremely high-resolution study (with 165 billion \nparticles) of an intermediate-sized volume, to show how the \nIGM gas is clumpy on very small scales, which greatly affects \nits recombination rate and the rate of large-scale reionization, \nand to resolve the smallest galactic halos -- the \"minihalos\" of \nmass below 100 million solar masses. What makes these high-resolution \nN-body results so special is that they will not only have extremely \nhigh mass resolution, they will have it in a large enough volume to \nshow how this small-scale structure is modulated by longer-wavelength \ndensity fluctuations, of the kind responsible for the large-scale \nstructure of the universe. This will then provide a spatially-varying, \nstatistical subgrid model for IGM gas clumping and minihalos to use \nin a large-scale reionization simulation of a much larger volume, \nutilizing our newly parallelized radiative transfer code, C2-RAY \n(\"Conservative, Causal, Ray-Tracing\"), to study the effect of gas \nclumping and minihalos on global reionization, as we transfer the \nradiation from the millions of galaxies within that volume. These \ntwo simulations, and two smaller-volume C2-Ray simulations that \nwill use the new N-body results directly to test the subgrid model, \nwill together require 7 million SUs requested here. They will \nreveal the critical impact of spatially-varying gas clumping and \nminihalos on cosmic reionization for the first time. \n\n[NEW PARAGRAPH]\nAmong the fundamental underpinings of the CDM universe cosmology which\nour studies of cosmic reionization adopt as the \"standard model\" are\nthe following: (1) the primordial density fluctuations responsible for\nstructure formation were Gaussian random noise with a scale-invariant\npower spectrum, as predicted by theories of cosmic inflation; and (2)\nthe total mass-energy density of the universe today is dominated by\ndark energy that acts like Einstein's cosmological constant and has\ncaused cosmic expansion to accelerate. These underpinnings are\nconsistent with current observations but will be subject to\nsignificantly improved test by upcoming, large-scale galaxy redshift\nsurveys of the epoch from the end of the EOR down to the present. For\nthis purpose, it is necessary to simulate the large-scale structure\nformation in a very large volume, large enough to compare directly\nwith the entire volume of these future galaxy surveys. This must be as\nlarge as ~100 cubic Gigaparsecs,to probe the shape of the primordial\ndensity fluctuation power spectrum and constrain non-Gaussianity,\nmeasure the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (\"BAO\") and probe the nature\nof dark energy. We propose to use the same CubeP3M N-body code we\ndescribed above for smaller-volume reionization simulations, also to\nperform a series of very large-scale structure (\"VLSS\") simulations to\nmodel these upcoming galaxy surveys. These latter simulations will\nrequire an additional 2.5 million SUs, bringing the total requested\nhere to 9.5 million SUs.\n",

                    "project_abstract": "We request computing time on the XSEDE resources to perform high-resolution, cosmological simulations of galaxy formation which will resolve the interstellar medium (ISM) physics with un- precedented realism. In our new physical model, the ISM is explicitly resolved into dense molecular clouds. Star formation is confined to these high-density regions and, as it proceeds, injects large quantities of energy and momentum into the surrounding medium via stellar feedback. This stellar feedback is critical to produce realistic galaxies and to generate powerful galactic winds. These galactic winds also have important effects on the circum-galactic and intergalactic media (CGM, IGM), and understanding them is a key frontier.\nFor the first time, we incorporate all the important stellar feedback mechanisms (radiation pressure in the ultra-violet, optical, and infrared; stellar winds; supernova explosions of Types I & II; and photoionization heating in HII regions) in a self-consistent manner. The combination of resolved, clumpy ISM and positive reinforcement of different feedback mechanisms produce powerful galactic winds with properties consistent with observations without ad hoc prescriptions, which previous simulations typically have had to incorporate.\nFor this initial study, our proposed simulations concentrate on the high-redshift Universe. This regime, of intense observational focus, is less computational expensive and will therefore allow us to simulate a range of galaxies (from dwarfs to massive disks) to develop a systematic understanding of the scale-dependent physics.\nThanks to their novelty and realism, the proposed set of simulations will be analyzed to address a wide array of timely scientific questions. We will study the evolution of the galactic ISM, galaxy growth and its self-regulation via galactic winds, the interaction of infalling material with galactic outflows, metal dispersion in the CGM and IGM, as well as the thermal, kinematic, and ionizing effects of galaxies on their surroundings. XSEDE resources provide the computational power necessary to perform our simulations, which have outgrown our local computing resources. We will use the well-tested smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code Gadget-3, which we significantly expanded to implement more realistic cooling, star formation, and feedback modules (also verified in a series of recent papers describing them).\nWe have successfully performed multiple medium-sized runs using the production version of the code on a university-based computing cluster and have successfully compiled and run basic scaling tests with the same version of the code on Ranger at TACC. This enabled us to estimate runtime requirements for our proposed simulations, totaling 1.76 million SUs.",

Our recent results indicate that we can potentially solve that puzzle in a region of parameter space which allows for the re-formation of the cold gas faster than its destruction through hydrodynamical instabilities. However, thus far we could merely show that this parameter space exists. In the proposed research, we want to bridge the gap to observations, and extend our work to realistic setups which include a non-homogeneous wind model, magnetic fields, and anisotropic thermal conduction. Each of these processes are present in galactic environments and will influence the outcome substantially, and are thus crucial to include in order to assess if this effect can indeed solve the \"entrainment problem\", and to compare our findings to observations.",

My work utilizes natural \"cosmic microscopes\" - taking advantage of intervening foreground galaxies between us and the more distant dusty galaxies, which magnify our view of the background galaxies in a process called gravitational lensing. In order to understand the intrinsic properties of the background galaxies, though, we must model the effects of this lensing. This is computationally difficult for data from the telescopes listed above, because they measure the Fourier transform of the sky instead of a direct image of it, and each observational dataset contains millions of observables.

Seismological and geochemical observations provide insights into the physics and chemistry of the Earth\u00e2??s interior. However, only by comparing mineral physics data (physical properties) with the seismological observations can we disentangle the thermal state of the deep Earth from its chemistry. Conventionally, as a first order approximation, the Earth\u00e2??s mantle is thought to be composed of a homogenous pyrolite. But, in reality, this region is far from being homogeneous. The distinct trace element signatures in mid ocean ridge and ocean island basalts reveal the heterogeneity in the Earth\u00e2??s mantle. Although the scale of the heterogeneity is unknown, it is likely that large regions of the mantle are composed of a depleted harzburgite and enriched crustal fractions.

In particular, how iron spin pairing transition couples with the ferroelastic transition. Finally we will also explore the effect of hydrogen defect on the structure and elasticity of hollandite.

We model pure Mg dislocation geometries and properties, as well as the effects of Al solutes via two main tasks: 1. determining the dislocation core for basal and non-basal dislocations in pure Mg at zero and finite stress using density-functional theory with flexible boundary conditions; 2. substituting Al at sites around the Mg dislocation cores to determine solute/dislocation interactions with density-functional theory.  Key to this work are high-performance computing resources to perform the study.\n\nThe objective of this study is to apply electronic-structure methods for the study of dislocations for Mg and Mg alloys and incorporate this data into finite-element constitutive models.  Connecting fundamental electronic structure studies of deformation at the atomistic scale to finite element modeling for new alloy design and direct incorporation in industrial usage is a potentially transformative concept in materials science and engineering.  It offers the promise to move beyond traditional trial-and-error approaches, and the combined talents of the academic-industrial collaboration is uniquely positioned to approach this problem.  Computational resources from TeraGrid combined with dedicated local resources are necessary to expand the work to enough dislocation types, stresses, and solute sites to provide meaningful data.",

Using our grant from last year, we accomplished most of what we outlined as a plan of research in last year's proposal, and submitted several papers based on that work: 1) we have determined the equilibrium particle shapes for olivine structure LiFePO4 and LiMnPO4 and calculated the energy barriers for lithium in the bulk region to diffuse out at the (010) surface. These factors control the morphology and performance of this important class of Li ion battery cathode materials. 2) We have calculated the bending strain energy, defect energy and interfacial energy in TiS2 nanotubes, and determined the optimal bending angle. These calculations permit a better understanding of the structure of inorganic nanotubes, which is crucial to accurate calculations of their electrochemical and other properties for Li ion battery applications. 3) We constructed the Pourbaix diagrams for both bulk and 0.5 to 2 nm diameter Pt nanoparticles, which helps us understand and improve the stability of Pt nanocatalysts. 4) We developed a method based on the cluster expansion formalism that makes highly accurate thermodynamic calculations of nano-structured materials computationally feasible, and applied it successfully to our test system of Au-Pd nanoparticles to predict ground state structures. This method allows us to extend our computational work to alloyed nanoparticles that are too large for the fully ab initio approach. We are requesting an allocation to allow us to advance our studies on several areas: in Li ion battery materials we will 1) continue the study of LiFePO4 nanoparticles with adsorbates to study how the equilibrium particle morphology is modified by different solution environments and predict optimal synthesis conditions, and 2) study lithiation reactions in alloyed metallic and oxide nanoparticles. 3) In fuel cell catalysis we will investigate the effects of alloying on Pt catalysts. 4) We will also evaluate different quantum mechanical, continuum and hybrid model in the study of electrochemical properties of room temperature ionic liquids for electrolyte and other applications. 5) We will evaluate the optical and transport properties of candidate materials for photovoltaic applications using the GW approximation. The amount of units we are requesting this year is higher than last year's allocation because of the fact that we are expanding our research program to include additional areas of energy technologies and also because of the increased complexity in our calculations.",

Initial attention to these materials was attributed to the discovery of the magnetic shape-memory effect in Ni2MnGa, which is now known as a prototypical \"smart material\". The magneto-structural coupling in Ni2MnGa allows a large external magnetic field to induce up to 10% reversible strain in this material, and vice versa, stress can cause up to 30% change in the magnetization. These properties gave rise to a number of new technologies, for example unique sensors and actuators. Search for better Heusler alloys becomes more intensive every year. Yet, microscopic understanding of what we are looking for in Heusler alloys is missing, because we have not identified the key physical observables that relate desired parameters of Heusler alloys with their chemical composition. The main objective of this project is to understand electronic origins of structural changes in Heusler alloys, and obtain theoretical phase diagrams, that would allow mapping of the physical properties of interest on the changes in stoichiometry of the material. It is proposed here to undertake a study of the electron-phonon interactions that should lead to a clearer connection between the electronic structure, phonon anomalies and chemical compositions. If the electron-phonon coupling is the key parameter that needs to be optimized, large-scale data based search in Heusler alloys can be undertaken.",

                    "project_abstract": "Next-generation energy systems, such as fuel cells, nuclear reactors, batteries, advanced oil and gas exploration systems will require materials that perform reliably under increasingly extreme conditions. Examples of extreme conditions encountered in energy systems include exposure to chemically reactive  corrosive  environments as aqueous fluids in fossil and nuclear plants, fuel cells, and water splitting; reactive and non-reactive gases at extreme temperatures and pressures as in solid oxide fuel cells, hydrogen transmission and storage, nuclear reactors; ionic liquids in fuel cells and batteries; steam, gases and hydrocarbons in oil shale processing, coal liquefaction. The chemical reactivity in these environments is further accelerated in the presence of mechanical loads and radiation fields. For the general infrastructure, it is not uncommon to quote 3-5% of the Gross National Product of any country as the corrosion bill to the society [1]. Overcoming the barriers caused by the inability of todays materials to function reliably in these extremes is a major challenge to enable secure, affordable energy with minimal adverse environmental impacts. Revolutionary advances are needed in reducing the degradation of materials due to reactivity in these aggressive conditions to meet the future energy challenges. For this purpose, a fundamental understanding of the thermodynamics and kinetics of unit processes that occur at the atomic level under such corrosive environments is needed (1).\nThe goal of this research is to quantitatively uncover the mechanisms that govern the corrosion kinetics in two energy-related contexts. The results of this research will ultimately lead to the development of physics-based predictive models for corrosion and guide the design of more durable material surfaces. The first context is the corrosion of zirconium alloys that are currently the canonical nuclear fuel cladding in water cooled nuclear reactors (the most commonly used nuclear plants in the world). The second is corrosion of low-chromium steels in oil fields containing hydrogen sulfide rich fluids. While these two systems look different in application, the scientific commonality we focus is on the stability of passive surface films that are critical in corrosion of both material systems - those are the zirconium oxide surface films in the former, and iron sulfide surface films in the latter. We will accomplish our goal through a multiscale computational approach linking first-principles electronic structure methods with atomistic simulations. In the rest of this section we describe the current state-of-knowledge of the mechanistic aspects of corrosion in the above mentioned energy-related systems. This description will allow us later on defining our Proposed Research and justifying the requested computational resources for this research. \n",

This also requires moving away from bulk CMOS in Si with SiO2 gate dielectrics.  It will probably involve the use of a buried strained Si layer for channel mobility enhancement and high-k dielectrics for gate leakage current reduction.  However, little is known about the fundamental behavior and properties of defects and dopants in strained Si layers and their interfaces with a-SiO2, (let alone high-k dielectrics). \nWe perform first principles calculations to determine: structure, stability, and bonding of defect and dopant clusters in amorphous/strained Si layers; formation and diffusion of mobile defect and defect-dopant complexes in strained Si layers and in the vicinity of a-c Si interfaces; and defect annihilation and dopant precipitation at strained-Si/a-SiO2 interfaces. \nWe perform first principles based classical molecular dynamics (or ab inito tight binding molecular dynamics, if necessary) simulations to examine complex dynamics occurring in amorphous Si.  Emphasis is placed on understanding: recrystallization of amorphous pockets in the presence of strain and defects; and dynamic behavior of defects in the vicinity of amorphous pockets.  The fundamental findings contribute to developing improved kinetic models for defect profiles during the early stages of post-implantation annealing.",

To scale up the superior mechanical properties of the individually confined nanometer-sized elements, load transfer and shear interactions must be optimized within the macroscopic material.  This great need has led to significant interest in the study of the fundamental deformation mechanisms of hierarchical layered materials composed of nanoscale elements. Designing such a class of layered materials draws its inspiration from Nature, who designs several strong and tough materials based on hierarchical structures, including bone, spider silk, and nacre from Red Abalone shell. For example, nacre is comprised of a hierarchical tablet-and-mortar structure of 95% brittle ceramic \u201ctablets\u201d (aragonite) and 5% organic polymer \u201cmortar\u201d.  This combination gives nacre a high modulus and a toughness that is ~3,000 times higher than the tablet material (aragonite) by means of a diffusive tablet sliding mechanisms, which is achieved by controlling material architecture, topology and interface properties. Here, we hypothesize that as in the case of natural materials, stiffness, strength, and toughness can be simultaneously optimized in novel composite materials, with hierarchical and discontinuous architectures, by selection of suitable building blocks, new interface chemistries, and constituent assembly with controlled geometrical overlap. The challenge is how does one identify the most promising combination of chemistry and geometrical overlaps, among the large number of possibilities available, for a particular combination of \u201ctablet\u201d and \u201cmortar\u201d building blocks?\n\nUnder the scope of the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI), we aim to accelerate the nanocomposite materials discovery and design, utilizing predictive computational models supported by highly selective experimental verification. While graphene has long been studied as a potential \u201cbrick\u201d for \u201cbrick-and-mortar\u201d nanocomposites, weak interfacial interactions between stacked sheets prevent effective scaling up. Graphene oxide (GO), a tunable, oxygen-functionalized derivative of graphene capable of strong interlayer hydrogen bonding, presents significant potential for overcoming this bottleneck.\n\nThe main objective for this project is the development of a predictive multiscale computational framework that accelerates the development of advanced materials. Specifically, the methodology proposed here focuses on the design of novel nanocomposites from multiple classes of materials, similar to computational alloys design, based on optimizing the materials selection, hierarchy and structure of the computationally predicted system. Inspired by natural materials such as nacre, we utilize GO and polymers as our building blocks. Through bottom-up computational modeling schemes, we aim to quickly assess the mechanical behavior of nanocomposites with different combinations of constituents as a function of hierarchy and structure of the system.",

The recent surge of new interest in catalysis by gold has led researchers to investigate the effects of adding gold to other metals. Alloying with palladium has been shown to form a bimetallic catalyst having superior activity, selectivity and stability towards various catalytic reactions such as carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation and hydrodesulfurization. In particular, palladium-gold (Pd-Au) alloy nanoclusters dispersed on titania (TiO2) often exhibit significantly improved efficiency for selective oxidation reactions, compared to Au/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2. Bimetallic Pd-Au catalysts have also recently received much attention for hydrogen fuel cell applications, because they are much less sensitive to CO poisoning than pure platinum or even platinum-ruthenium alloy catalysts. While mechanisms underlying the synergetic effect are ambiguous, recent evidence suggests that the reactivity of oxide-supported bimetallic metal nanocatalysts is determined by a complex combination of metal-metal interactions in metal clusters, metal-support interactions, and metal cluster sizes and shapes. However, little is known about the atomic structure and composition of Pd-Au nanoclusters, let alone their interfacial interactions with the TiO2 support.  \r\nUsing first principles calculations this research focuses on developing a better understanding of the alloying effects of supported bimetallic nanoclusters towards various catalytic reactions.  Special emphasis will be placed on understanding how the metal-metal and metal-support interactions determine the structure and composition of the supported metal alloys, and in turn their chemical reactivity.  For model systems, we will examine bimetallic Pd-Au thin films and TiO2-supported Pd-Au mixed nanoclusters, and their reactivity towards oxidation of CO and H2, relative to their pure counterparts.  The Pd-Au and Au-Pd/TiO2 systems will serve as excellent models for studying the nature of supported bimetallic nanocatalysts, particularly gold and palladium-group-metal alloys.  While current experimental techniques alone are limited to providing complementary real space information, the synergetic interplay between theory and experiment will contribute greatly to developing a better understanding of the structure, composition, and reactivity of oxide-supported Pd-Au nanoclusters.  Progress from this proposal will also offer an invaluable guide to the rational design and fabrication of bimetallic nanocluster-based materials for various catalytic applications.",

Soft materials encompass solid composites or liquid dispersions whose molecular species form the nanoscopic building blocks which assemble into structures spanning large length scales (angstroms to microns.) In addition to molecular-scale interactions between nanoscopic elements, the kinetics and thermodynamics of the structure and dynamics of these materials is dictated by physical forces which are predominant in these length scales: friction, electrostatics and hydrodynamics. The complex interplay between these key forces determines the structure or composition of these materials, and their responses to changes in the external environment such as acidity, temperature or light radiation. Fundamental insight into the morphology and dynamics of these materials will require the development and utilization of a suite of modeling tools with each class of tools tuned to address physical phenomena over a specific spatio-temporal scale. These multiple modeling techniques have to be interfaced at the juncture of two scales to enable a multiscale resolution of the system behavior over large length and time scales (nano-seconds to micro-seconds.) We harness these methodologies to develop a fundamental understanding of the various mechanisms underlying the interaction between cells and surfaces, for applications in targeted drug delivery, cellular sensing and antifouling. We are interested in the conception and design of bio-inspired membranes, vesicles, suitable biocompatible delivery vehicles and functionalized surfaces with specific interactions, via the use of mesoscopic computational models and techniques.

The simulations for all the projects will be carried out on TACC Stampede using an open source Molecular Dynamics (MD) code entitled Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) [1]. To compare the run time measurements for the different number of processors, we measure the run Time per number of Particles per number of Iterations (TPI) for different number of processors.

The goal of this research work is to advance capabilities for predictive modeling and simulation of metal nanostructure formation and stability. The nanoclusters considered in this work are formed by deposition on single-component single-crystal metal substrates, on binary alloy substrates, and/or on graphene substrates supported on flat surfaces of certain metals. We develop realistic atomistic-level models which have predictive capability, and can thus elucidate and guide experiments. Our model requires very many precise energetic parameters (both for thermodynamics and kinetics) as input. These energies must be obtained from a large number of density functional theory calculations with high convergence standards and high precision. These NSF-supported studies are of fundamental importance to advance the understanding of the formation and relaxation of metal nanostructures on specific surfaces, and potentially of the interaction of those nanostructures with chemisorbed species.",

This project requires an exploration of multiple, long MD trajectories for ensembles of millions of atoms under different conditions: different solvents, polymer concentrations and polymer chemistry. In the mean time, drawing on atomistic MD simulations, we will develop polymer coarse-grained model and high efficient lattice simulation to study polymer supramolecular structures under solvent effect at mesoscopic scale.\n\nThe simulations will be performed using the software packages of Gromacs, Lammps and our own code. We have carried out preliminary simulations of the systems of 1.2 million atoms in shorter time (less than 100 ns) using atomistic MD simulations.

                    "project_abstract": "Secondary energy storage technologies based on sodium ions are an important emerging alternative to lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Sodium is less expensive than lithium, with its supplies being much wider and more democratically distributed throughout the globe. Therefore, there is the potential for significantly reduced system cost, as well as for increased energy security due to ease of obtaining sodium precursors as compared to lithium carbonate. Hybrid sodium ion capacitors (NICs) and dedicated high power sodium ion batteries (NIBs) are energy storage devices that are meant to bridge the power \u00e2?? cyclability \u00e2?? energy density gap of conventional secondary batteries and supercapacitors. Due to their electrode architecture these devices may operate at rates near or even above 60C (1C being one hour charge), i.e., single minute charge or discharge. Their enhanced energy as compared to supercapacitors is due to the electrodes that offer the potential for bulk Na storage, as well as due to the Na ion electrolyte that operates at higher voltages as compared to acetonitrile, etc. \n\nA survey of literature indicates that the most optimum negative (anode) electrodes for NICs consist of high surface area two-dimensional (2-D) carbons, such as various high surface area carbon nanosheets reported in literature. To date the intermediate and fast Na charge storage mechanisms in such carbons are poorly understood. The perception is that at rates such as 5C, 10C or even 60C, it is effectively \u00e2??business-as-usual\u00e2?\u009d: For instance, carbon nanosheet electrodes that intercalate Na ions at C/3 are assumed to operate comparably at much higher rates. A wide survey of existing scientific literature shows minimal discussion regarding any transitions in dominant charge storage or capacity loss mechanisms as the charging rate is increased. Moreover, while there is a wide variability in the Coulombic efficiency and cycling lifetime values reported for 2-D carbons with Na, the origin of either is not understood. This combined experimental \u00e2?? simulation proposal seeks to provide new fundamental insight into these unexplored aspects of Na charge storage in 2-D carbons with a range of structure and chemistries. \n\nOur modeling effort will combine various state-of-the-art theoretical methods. It will address the fundamental issues regarding the Na ion storage behavior at the interface between electrolyte and the carbon. The role of graphene ordering, various carbon defects, and heteroatom chemistry will be considered in detail. We will systematically employ graphene-like carbon nanosheet electrodes as model anode structures containing nanopores, topological defects, heteroatoms (B, N, P, S), and combined dopant-defect complexes. This unique proposed work speaks to the core of the structure-properties relations in an emerging class of Na based energy storage systems (NICs and NIBs). It will answer the fundamental questions regarding how Na is reversibly and irreversibly stored within imperfect carbons. With the successful execution of this research, it is expected that many of the existing \u00e2??battery-inherited\u00e2?\u009d paradigms regarding high rate Na storage would be disrupted.",

Thermodynamic properties of Li-Mn-Co-Ni-O system for battery applications (600k SUs); 8. First-principles calculation of thermodynamic and kinetic properties of CZTSSe solar absorber materials (360k SUs). Most of the projects are funded by National Science Foundation (NSF) with some funded by Department of Defense (DoD) Army Research Lab and Pratt-Whitney. The results obtained by first-principles calculations will be integrated with CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams) modeling to predict complex multi-component materials properties. The requested resources are for the proposed first-principles calculations, all of which will be performed using the VASP code, one of the most efficient and accurate density functional theory tools available. VASP is widely used on the XSEDE machines and runs efficiently on Stampede, which are where we are requesting SUs.",

                    "project_abstract": "Traditional alloys used in engineering applications, including steels and aluminum alloys, are formed of a primary constituent (solvent) element with other elements added in relatively small quantities to enhance material properties.  However, the inclusion of large quantities of alloying elements tends to lead to the formation of intermetallics, rather than a single solid solution, which can dramatically reduce ductility and mechanical processing ability. We are developing novel high entropy alloys (HEAs), which, unlike traditional alloys, have four or more elements in roughly equiatomic proportions. Examples of these alloys have demonstrated mechanical properties greatly exceeding those of conventional engineering metals. However, the mechanisms by which these complex alloys are formed and improved properties achieved are not well understood. Our overall goal is to develop an experimentally-validated, systematic model based on first-principles calculations to enable further development of HEA systems. This research is supported by NSF grant OISE-1261525. The PI and undergraduate students have implemented methods using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) to enable computation of partial phase diagrams of HEA alloy systems and the elastic constants of specific alloys. We are in the process of implementing methods to calculate stacking fault energy, Peierls stress, and flow stress as well. Several of these properties can be experimentally verified and are potentially predictive of high performance materials. We have already successfully used VASP to predict crystal structures, phase diagrams, and elastic properties for single elements and well-characterized binary alloys. As we move to simulating HEAs, we require more computational resources than are available to us at Harvey Mudd College. We request XSEDE resources to run our simulations on several alloy families of interest. ",

The past studies show it has four main advantages: high selectivity, tunable stability, high mass activity and tunable activity. Currently SAC is still at infancy stage, there are still many important questions need to be explored both from scientific and industrial point of view: the micro structure environment of active site, and stability, the diversity of tuning activity, etc.  These questions has put a   grand challenge for the traditional experimental method.  DFT simulation is becoming a more powerful method and I will us the this method give a atomic explanation of the chemical process to study the energy related catalyst for the activation of small molecules, such as H2, O2, N2, H2O.

The structural and in-core components of a VHTR are exposed to small amounts of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, water vapor and methane. The impurities will react with the alloys through three reactions \u00e2?? oxidation, carburization, and decarburization. The chromium phase in both alloys reacts with the oxygen to form a protective coating (Cr2O3) that helps as a corrosion-resistant environmental barrier across a range of temperatures. When the carbon potential in the alloy is lower than in the gas, carburization takes place. The carbides are susceptible to chemical disintegration depending on the carbon potential\n\nThe first objective of our work is to assess the structure and properties of stable chromia in the presence of the impurities. We will utilize Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) and Quantum ESPRESSO with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) method. The projected augmented wave (PAW) method will be used to describe the core and valence electron interactions. The exchange-correlation interactions will be described using Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) with the GGA functional. In order to accurately account for the strong correlations between the d electrons in transition metals (such as Cr, Fe), the DFT+U approach will be employed. To assess the entropic effects, we will also perform large scale classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at finite temperatures with empirical potentials using the LAMMPS software.",

The functional polymers are tailored to contain specific moieties that enable precise, spatially-targeted control over work-function and charge-carrier doping of the 2D material. The second grant (CBET-1803614) will study metal core-2D shell nanoparticles designed for stabilization of catalytically active phases of the 2D materials and optimal control of catalytic activity and selectivity. Both projects involve the application of first-principles modeling as a key step in informing rational selection and design of hybrid organic-inorganic materials and core-shell nanoparticles, elucidating their fundamental physico-chemical properties, and providing mechanistic understanding into complementary experiments. The primary electronic structure code to be used for these two projects is the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP).

Since it is still largely unknown how nanoparticles will impact the environment, nanotechnology could lead to serious environmental problems.  Moreover,  there is still a substantial need to comprehensively investigate all physicochemical and biological properties of nanoparticles to predict possible impact.\n\nThe goal of the NSF CREST Interdisciplinary Center for Nanotoxicity (ICN) at Jackson State University is to develop an understanding of the potentially complex interplay between properties of different  nanomaterials and the health of ecosystems (impact to environment) using computational and experimental approaches. The Center analyzes the basic properties of the investigated nanoparticles that will lead to the thorough understanding of their behavior in physical processes, environments, relationship between physicochemical properties and biological activity/toxicity. Detailed physicochemical and toxicological characterization of different nanomaterials will ultimately have numerous applications in the industry and environmental hazard assessments and certainly will lead to development of reliable risk and safety evaluations to ensure their safety for human health and the environment. The activity of the Center is focused on the following directions:\n\n1. Physicochemical properties of nanoparticles. Computational and experimental prediction of  fundamental physicochemical properties, including quantum-chemical parameters, size-dependent parameters, composition-dependent parameters, and surface-dependent parameters that determine the intrinsic features of nanoparticles.\n\n2. Interactions of nanoparticles with biological systems and small molecules. The studies are carried out by comprehensive ab initio quantum-chemical calculations at high level of theory for small systems and using hybrid molecular mechanics/quantum-mechanical, classical force files and docking methods for larger systems.\n\n3. SAR studies, toxicity effects and environmental risks assessment of nanoparticles. The structure-activity paradigms applicable for nanoparticles are developed. According to this concept, the structure-property relationships and especially, the nanoparticle-toxicity relationships for different endpoints are being comprehensively investigated to reveal the mechanisms of nanoparticles toxicity and then to use such information to assess the environmental risks.",

                    "project_abstract": "This research project focuses on the development of a hybrid, multiscale simulation approach to predict the equilibrium and dynamical properties of polymer nanocomposites. Polymer nanocomposites are materials synthesized by the addition of a small weight fraction of anisotropic filler particles to polymeric matrices. There has been a recent surge of interest in these materials due to their unique materials properties such as modulus, fire retardency gas permeability and rheology. Many of these property enhancements are quite uncharacteristic of what one might expect in the addition of such small amounts of fillers to polymeric matrices. Consequently, an unresolved and an active area of current research is to try and unearth the fundamental mechanisms by which such fillers impact upon the structure and properties of polymers.  \n\nWe have undertaken a computational approach to address the above question. But, this approach is by no means trivial. On the one hand, the filler particles are highly anisotropic and has atleast one dimension of nanometers. On the other hand, the polymers need to be modeled at the scale of monomers which are in Angstroms. These disparate length scales suggest the development of a multiscale simulation approach. We have developed a preliminary version of a multiscale approach that combines the molecular dynamics simulation for the particles with a coarse-grained approach termed as dissipative particle dynamics for the polymers. This effectively addresses the above issues, and can potentially be used to map out the mechanistic details of the polymer nanocomposite system.\n\nDespite the use of a multiscale simulation idea, the simulations necessitate extensive computational resources to get rid of system size effects and also to obtain good statistical sampling for the dynamical simulations. Currently, our research group resources have around 20 workstations which are shared between this project and two other computationally intensive projects. We are requesting these resources on TACC to enable fruition of this high impact project. This research also impact indirectly upon many experimental groups at UT Austin who are actively pursuing the synthesis and applications of polymeric nanocomposites. Those researches can also be expected to benefit from expedited results that can suggest rational strategies for designing such materials.",

Recently, we have been developing new encapsulation processes using these liquid-repellent materials. Even though designing such surfaces has shown to be very challenging, we aim at accelerating the creation and the optimization of these materials by using computational tools. In recent years, as a result of an increasing computational power of both mainstream and cutting-edge hardware, it has become possible and easier to study classical systems of hundreds of thousands of atoms over a few nanoseconds with classical molecular dynamics. Our main objective is to support our experimental results with computational models (why a given material is \"more\" efficient than another material), which would provide us with a better understanding of the underlying physical and chemical mechanisms in our systems. The first part of our project would mostly consist of a computational study of our new encapsulating techniques, and the different diffusion mechanisms that occur within these systems. The second part of this project focuses more on the design of liquid-repellent surfaces in general, which would eventually clear the path toward high-throughput computations to accelerate material design of liquid-repellent coatings and bio-inspired encapsulation processes. \nOur workhorse will mainly lie in classical molecular dynamics (MD) methods, with a possible support coming from Grand Canonical Monte Carlo methods.

The uncertainties in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models as well as the high nonlinearity of convective weather make probabilistic forecast information that can be provided by convection-allowing ensembles especially valuable to forecasters. Advanced data assimilation (DA) is needed to provide accurate initial conditions (IC) while optimized ensemble-based DA techniques such as the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) can provide theoretically the best possible estimate of the initial condition uncertainties what are needed to initialize ensemble forecasting systems.  \nCAPS has since 2007 continued to push the envelope of high-performance computing, conducting highly successful realtime storm-scale ensemble forecast (SSEF) experiments utilizing XSEDE computing resources at PSC, NICS and TACC, in collaboration with the NOAA Hazardous Weather Testbed (HWT) Spring Forecasting Experiment (SFE), and since 2016 the NOAA Hydrometeorological Testbed (HMT) Flash Flood and Intensive Rainfall (FFaIR) Experiment. CAPS realtime experiments are designed to test and evaluate the most advanced data assimilation systems and ensemble forecasting techniques designed for predicting high-resolution convective-scale weather, and the data sets generated will be used by the CAPS scientists as well as collaborators to help answer many scientific questions related to the prediction of severe weather. Close collaborating organizations include the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) operational centers (The Storm Prediction Center, Weather Prediction Center, and Environmental Modeling Center), research centers include the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the Developmental Testbed Center). The experiments are expected to lead to optimal designs and advanced capabilities that can be implemented at the NCEP Operational Centers, and thereby to improve forecasting of severe weather such as tornadoes, severe hail, damaging winds, and flash floods.  The CAPS forecast data sets generated on the TerGrid and Xsede resources have resulted in more than 40 referred journal publications. \nThrough this proposal, scientists from CAPS seeks XSEDE resources on TACC Stampede and PSC Bridges to support its 2017 realtime storm-scale ensemble data assimilation and forecasting and related research in collaboration with the 2017 HWT SFE and HMT FFaIR forecast experiments.

This work builds off our pilot study (Bustard et al. 2018) run on Stampede2 under a previous start-up allocation (TG-AST170033; PI: Chad Bustard,Co-PI: Ellen Zweibel). In this work, we used the FLASH magnetohydrodynamics code to simulate outflows from the LMC during it's infall through the Milky Way halo, and we found the interaction between weak \"fountain\" flows and the headwind experienced by the LMC to be important in ultimately expelling gas. Our proposed work will probe the additional effects of magnetic fields and cosmic rays, some of the most highly energetic particles in the universe, including a novel implementation of the so-called cosmic ray streaming instability. This extremely sub-grid interaction between charged cosmic ray particles and plasma waves has been approximated in a fluid treatment and can have large-scale effects on galaxy evolution. With these additions to our model, we will undertake a study of cosmic ray and thermally driven outflows from the LMC and SMC, varying key parameters such as method of cosmic ray transport, initial magnetic field strength,  and  level  of  supernova  clustering.  We  will  then  create  synthetic  observations  using extensively tested visualization toolkits,  and we will compare these directly to the wealth of observational data on the Magellanic System. By using the Clouds, two of the most well-studied extra-galactic objects in the Universe, as test-beds for outflow launching, we can, for the first time, connect resolved star formation histories and detailed observations of galaxies to their supernova-driven expulsions. Using observational constraints on the magnetic field strength, cosmic ray population, star cluster masses, etc., we can probe what works and what doesn't to launch the observed outflows. This is of vital importance to understanding how galaxies self-regulate their star formation by transferring gas to the intergalactic medium, and it will provide a useful case-study for dwarf galaxy evolution in general.",

Unfortunately, simulations run to the late Universe are forced to sacrifice physical and modeling detail due to computing limitations, which leaves the epoch fertile to observationally-constrained semi-analytic or empirical modeling efforts to bridge this gap. However, new phenomena and environments that lie on the edge of our observational frontier are less constrained and would benefit from a well-tested, first principles approach to numerical modeling. We propose to perform these tests by bringing full-physics ``zoom-in\" cosmological simulations forward to the present day whereupon we will conduct a thorough Monte Carlo radiative transfer analysis on the resulting galaxies. After comparing and validating our techniques against observations, we will then proceed to produce detailed, high-resolution mock catalogs of both local galaxies and their higher-redshift progenitors. We will be able to provide predictions of light to mass ratios, half-light radii, emission line strengths, UV luminosity as well as other measures and correlate them directly to the composition, evolution history, and inclination of various types of galaxies. Our goal is to better account for micro physics in applications throughout galactic astronomy as well as facilitate tighter bounds and higher confidence for future novel observations.",

The first set of simulations will build on our previous work to explore the interaction of radiation, dust, and gas in rapidly star forming environments.  These calculations will allow us to better understand the role small scale instabilities play in limiting the exchange of momentum between stellar radiation and interstellar gas. They will allow us to test simple analytic models and the sub grid prescriptions used in galaxy and cosmological scale simulations to model such interactions.  A second set of MHD simulations will examine the effects of realistic opacities on the structure and dynamics of accretion flows around supermassive black holes. Recent work has shown that ultraviolet line opacity can significantly alter the structure and thermal properties of the envelopes of massive stars. Supermassive black hole accretion disks are in a similar temperature and density regime, but there have been no attempts to account for such opacity in previous numerical or analytic models. These simulations will utilize recently developed radiation transfer modules for the Athena MHD code. Previous work has demonstrated that our radiative transfer algorithms yield more accurate and qualitatively different results from the diffusion approximation or M1 closure methods commonly employed in other codes.  Hence, we are uniquely well-placed to perform the calculations outlined below.",

Understanding how stars form is crucial even for seemingly unconnected fields of astronomy, Their formation includes a wide range of physical phenomena: both super- and subsonic turbulence, magnetic fields, weakly ionized plasmas, continuum and line radiative processes compounded by complex chemical processes and gravity, making the problem of star formation extremely complex. The difficulty is further compounded by the wide dynamic range of the problem: the process of star formation is initiated in giant molecular clouds (GMCs), which are 9 orders of magnitude larger than the protostars and stars that form in the end. \n\nOur goal is to understand the roles turbulence, magnetic fields, radiative feedback, outflows and the local environment play in star formation, on scales from individual stars and protostars to GMCs. The proposed simulations will be used to address the following questions:\n1) What physical mechanisms are responsible for setting the masses of individual stars? \n2) How do different feedback mechanisms (e.g., radiation, outflows) interact to regulate star formation in GMCs? \n3) What determines the physical properties of star clusters that form in a given environment? How do the properties of the progenitor cloud affect the mass, size, and density profile of the resulting star clusters? \n\nUnlike previous studies that were confined to a small region of a GMC, the simulations we propose here will provide a self-consistent picture of a cloud disrupted by long-range feedback (e.g., winds and radiation from O-stars, supernovae). We propose a series of runs with progressively more complicated physics: starting from pure isothermal collapse, then adding magnetic fields, cooling physics, dust, protostellar heating and outflows and main sequence stellar feedback.This step-by-step approach will allow us to identify the role of each physical process in star formation in a self-consistent framework for the first time.",

The objective of our effort is to develop a technique for the characterization of the natural depositional fabric of sands by scanning and testing undisturbed samples obtained in routine geotechnical site investigations. To this end we obtained thin wall tube samples of sand collected during a site investigation at Treasure Island in the San Francisco Bay. We used small diameter plastic tubes to obtain undisturbed cylindrical samples for scanning and triaxial testing at the Laboratory 3SR at Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes.

Understanding the physics of these jets is a key challenge in plasma astro- physics, for they are a powerful natural mechanisms of energy transport.\nOne paradigm to explain the formation of jets in PPN, in particular, is that of a binary stellar system in which material from the wind of an AGB star is gravitationally pulled onto an intermediate-mass companion. A hot magnetized rapidly rotating plasma disk will be formed about the companion star. The rotational and magnetic energy of this disk will then lead to the launch and collimation of jets. Several fundamental questions remain open in this scenario however. In particular which kinds binaries, (i.e. for which separations and mass ratios), form stable accretion disks? Do all disks form jets? What affects the stability of disk driven jets?\nBased on novel results obtained with our previous start-up XSEDE allocation (TG-AST120029) we propose to carry out a series of three-dimensional Adaptive Mesh Refinement parallel numerical simulations to study the formation, struc- ture and stability, and observational implications, of interacting stellar binaries. This will include (1) accretion from the primary AGB wind onto a secondary star and (2) launch and propagation of strongly magnetized jets. Our compu- tations will be performed with higher resolution and longer time-scales than attempted in previous studies and we will be using our locally developed, well tested code AstroBEAR 2.0 for the simulations. Binary-formed accretion disks will be investigated for stellar separations of 10, 20, 30, 40astronomical units and for mass ratios of 1.5. We will also study strongly magnetized jets in both adiabatic and cooling regimes using toroidal-to-poloidal magnetic component ratios of .1, 1, 10, 100.\nWhile we are in full production mode with AstroBEAR 2.0 the numerical resources of the XSEDE that we are requesting are needed to make further progress on unraveling the fundamental questions concerning interacting bina- ries and their disks/outflows. To achieve this goal we request the support of 4 million SUs on Kraken at NICS and 4 million SUs on Ranger at TACC.",

This problem has never been self-consistently simulated in a relativistic framework, making it difficult to apply existing theory to the most energetic and extreme objects, the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars, due to the large relativistic effects introduced by their rapid rotation. We propose to perform a set of five three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of disk accretion onto rapidly rotating, magnetized stars, in order to investigate the torques exerted on the star, the matter ejected from the disk by the rotating stellar field lines, and the jets produced by the star-disk system. These simulations are especially timely given the recent discovery of transitional millisecond pulsars, which have been observed in both accreting (X-ray) and isolated (radio) pulsar states, implying a cyclical invasion of an accretion disk into the pulsar magnetosphere.",

Modern catalysis exists for about 100 years, but catalyst design and development remains by and large a time-consuming experimental trial-and-error process. The discovery of density functional theory (DFT) and the availability of large computational resources have already started to have a significant impact on our understanding of catalysis, and more importantly, they become increasingly applicable for the in silico design of new catalytic materials. The most successful approach for the identification of novel catalysts is known as computational catalyst screening, which encompasses three main steps: (i) the identification of the dominant reaction mechanism and the key reaction intermediates; (ii) the determination of a small set of catalytic reactivity descriptors that can predict reactivity and selectivity trends; and (iii) the calculation of these reactivity descriptors on new catalysts.\nIn the PIs group at the University of Houston (UH) we apply computational catalysis techniques, primarily DFT, to study catalytic process that enable the more efficient use of natural resources. This includes the utilization of abundant natural gas and biomass as fuel and feedstock for the production of valuable chemicals. The use of different fuels in vehicles, e.g. natural gas engines, also requires novel catalytic converters for emissions aftertreatment.

Important petro-physical quantities such as porosity, pore-size, fracture connectivity, and wettability of OM pores in organic-rich shale depend on the thermal maturity, kerogen type, chemical composition, and presence of surface functionalized groups. A better understanding of the hydrocarbon storage and fracture properties in nano-confined OM systems as a function of maturity, type, and composition could significantly improve the reservoir characterization, planning, and development of unconventional resource plays. Developing such an understanding is an outstanding challenge, and requires a comprehensive investigation into the chemistry and petrophysics of nano-confined OM systems. These challenges represent opportunities for fundamental research that can have a direct impact on an important and developing industrial process.\n\nWe propose to investigate the effects of nano-pore confinement on hydrocarbon storage and fracture properties of isolated kerogen using computational thermodynamics and simulations, integrated with low-field NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance), BET (gas adsorption), and SEM (scanning electron microscopy) measurements of saturated kerogen samples of various maturity, type, and composition. A saturating fluid with large affinity to the kerogen surface, such as methane or pentane, will serve as a probe of the phase behavior and storage of hydrocarbons in kerogen nano-pores. A saturating fluid with small affinity to the kerogen surface, such as a water-based hydraulic-fracture fluid, will serve as a probe for transport of fracture fluids and potential wettability alteration of kerogen. Besides addressing fundamental scientific and technological challenges in describing fluids under confinement, the proposed research will contribute science and technology that can aid  our quest to become self-reliant in energy  by increasing ultimate hydrocarbon recovery from these complex unconventional reservoirs.",

                    "project_abstract": "A theoretical investigation on the effects of transition metal dopants on different rare earth oxides (REOs) is proposed.  The proposed work is supported in conjunction with a National Science Foundation experimental grant (CHE 1464765) that focuses on preparing REO catalysts, and investigating their surface reactivity and selectivity under realistic conditions. More specifically we propose to investigate the effects of Ni, Pd, V and W on ceria, terbia and samaria.  The current proposal is a revised research allocation request for computing time on XSEDE resources to supersede a startup allocation (CTS160003) awarded in January 2016. During the startup allocation, preliminary calculations were completed on Stampede to create a reaction framework for pertinent chemical reaction pathways involved in the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM). This preliminary work focused on the undoped surface of ceria (CeO2) (111) in order to establish the framework involved for partial and complete oxidation of methane. The preliminary investigation has identified ~30 elementary reaction steps on the ceria surface and will facilitate future studies.  Performing calculation concurrently with experiments can help to identify key thermodynamic and kinetic reaction results that can reveal information about better catalytic materials to test under experimental conditions. While funds for theoretical calculations were not included in this NSF project, we feel that a computational study of the effects of dopants could add significant value to the overall experimental NSF project as well as to the expertise and skill set acquired by the students.",

                    "project_abstract": "Methanol to hydrocarbon (MTH) reactions are known to be catalyzed by proton form zeolites. Small pore zeolites (e.g. TON) exhibit higher selectivity towards lighter hydrocarbons, as well as lower rates than zeolites with larger cavities such as MFI, which are more selective towards gasoline-range hydrocarbons. Light alkenes (such as ethene, propene, and isobutene) are primarily formed via an aromatically co-catalyzed process. It is unknown, however, which aromatic species are most effective at co-catalyzing alkene formation, which alkene is the preferred product, and the exact mechanism for this co-catalyzed cycle. These aromatic co-catalysts can also react with alkenes to form polycyclic (e.g. naphthalene) coke precursors which lead to zeolite deactivation. The zeolite framework and location of the Brnsted acid site within the zeolite can have an effect on the reactivity, selectivity, and deactivation rates, because the diverse environments within the zeolite framework stabilize intermediates and transition states to different extents. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations will be used in this work to investigate three mechanisms of aromatically-co-catalyzed alkene (C2-C4) formation using a variety of aromatic co-catalysts at multiple acid-site locations within the MFI zeolite. These efforts will determine the critical steps which ultimately control the rate, selectivity, and deactivation of MFI during MTH reaction, which will enable the rapid evaluation of a wide range of frameworks.",

                    "project_abstract": "The nucleus of eukaryotic cells is a membrane-bound organelle which stores a near meter long genomic DNA within its micrometre-sized confines. Most of the nuclear space is taken up by the DNA in tight association with proteins which together form a complex and out of equilibrium nuclear material known as chromatin. The physical state of chromatin as defined by its architecture, dynamics and biochemical markings can directly influence and regulate many important genetic processes. The dense and slow diffusing regions of chromatin correspond to genetically silenced areas known as heterochromatin, while more mobile and diffuse regions are known as euchromatin. The fundamental principles and driving forces which govern the dynamics and spatial order of chromosomes, nuclear bodies and euchromatin-heterochromatin are poorly understood. Latest experiments, however, have been finding that on micrometre scales chromatin acts as a viscoelastic complex liquid-like material. Specifically, liquid-liquid phase separation of disordered proteins was found responsible for desegregation of heterochromatin and euchromatin territories very much like how oil droplets behave in water. The idea based on viscoelastic phase separation is rapidly emerging as a universal organization principle capable of explaining the subnuclear architecture and paving a way for predictive modelling of nuclear scale chromatin dynamics. To this end have embarked on developing a general computational framework based on phase-field methodology that captures the basic physics of liquid-liquid like phase separation of intra and inter-chromosomal euchromatin and heterochromatin. The computational framework is called MEsoscale Liquid mOdel of Nucleus (MELON) and is based on a finite element solution of reaction/diffusion equations. Simulations are carried out using C++ utilizing MOOSE numerical library which we have implemented and tested extensively using the startup and supplement allocations on Stampede2. Our preliminary work shows the success of using a liquid like models of chromatin dynamics in that we are able to capture several features of large scale nuclear architecture and dynamics. In particular, we are able to explain the experimentally observed long time and length scale nuclear reorganization processes accompanying phenotypic changes and nuclear architecture inversion by only using a minimal set of physical assumptions and parameters. Our long-term objective is to continue the development of mesoscale modelling techniques and making holistic models that can reconcile data from nuclear imaging and genomics experiment and provide means for predictively modelling salient features of nuclear reorganization starting from physics based principles.",

Many of the alternative energy sources being considered to reduce our dependence upon fossil fuels are limited by material properties.  Examples include photovoltaic materials for energy production from sunlight, catalysts for energy conversion to and from chemical fuels, and storage in the form of electrochemical energy in batteries.  The key to designing new materials is a good understanding of the relationship between the material structure and its function.  Theory and modeling are playing an increasingly important role in determining these structure-function relationships.  In the field of catalysis, for example, the binding energy of chemicals to a catalyst surface have been shown to be good descriptors of catalytic activity.  For Li-ion battery materials, the binding of Li determines the cell voltage and diffusion barriers determine the potential current density.  Enabled with reactivity descriptors, computational methods can be used to rapidly screen and search for new materials.  In this project, existing collaborations with synthetic and analytical chemists will be leveraged to validate reactivity descriptors on functional materials for energy conversion and storage.  Specifically, nanoparticle catalysts for oxygen reduction, high capacity cathode materials for Li batteries, and doped oxides for photovoltaic applications will be targeted. The use of computational screening and gradient-based optimization in chemical compound space will then be used to predict new materials with improved function.  Through a close collaboration between theory and experiment, this approach will reduce the slow trial-and-error process of materials discovery and move towards the goal of materials-by-design.",

An optimal catalytic material will be highly active for a desired reaction while selective against non-desired reactions that reduce process efficiency and create unwanted byproducts.  For heterogeneous catalytic processes, activity and selectivity are determined by the energetics of breaking and forming bonds on a solid surface, which are influenced by the catalyst composition, structure, as well as the reaction environment.  Quantum chemical calculations have become an essential tool in connecting catalyst and environment to the resulting activity and selectivity, guiding rational design of catalysts and catalytic processes.

The proposed research will use DFT and high-level quantum mechanical computations, as a part of our ongoing effort to extend the mechanistic studies for C-H activations in methanol ODH reactions to various small reactant molecules of relevance in industrial processes for production of energy, fuels and chemicals, and to probe the mechanism of O2 activation required for re-oxidizing the catalyst reduced in the C-H activation step. We anticipate that the proposed research involving comparisons at different levels of theory, together with experimental work being performed at the LSAC laboratory, will establish a new state of the art for computational studies of selective oxidations and advance our understanding of general trends of reactivity in these reactions with reactant and catalyst properties.  The O2 activation calculations will lead to improved understanding of re-oxidaiton mechanism reduced metal oxides; prevalent reactive species such as surface-peroxide-type electrophilic oxygen will potentially be determined from such calculations will help guide experiments that specifically scavenge these species via O-insertion reactions.",

XSEDE computing resources will enable CAPS to conduct high-resolution urban and regional climate simulations to address the following important issues.      \n\nCities are currently facing unprecedented challenge due to continued global urbanization and global warming.  Nowadays, more than half of population live in cities, and this fraction is expected to increase to two thirds in the following half century. The high dwelling intensity leads to a few urban environmental issues, such as urban heat island (UHI), urban air pollution, and urban water crisis. High-resolution numerical model simulations were proven very useful to investigate these issues [Hu and Xue, 2016; Hu et al., 2013]      \n\nThe Great Plains region is known for frequent hazardous convective weather and climate extremes.  Future climate in the Great Plains is projected to be more arid as temperature and evapotranspiration increase with an increased frequency of extreme precipitation events - essentially drought punctuated by flood.  Previous climate assessments in this region using coarse-resolution GCMs have largely avoided any conclusions regarding potential changes of hazardous convective weather due to their inability to simulate these small scale extreme processes. Probabilistic high-resolution dynamically downscaled climate projection is warranted to provide the information needed for key local decision-making at relevant (field-level) scales, especially for a region such as the south Great Plains [Sun et al., 2016].",

ITDEaSM will be developed by coupling and adding capability to a suite of community models to address grand challenges in decadal regional climate predictions and fill in major gaps in existing climate, Earth system, and ecosystem modeling.  Multi-decadal simulations will be performed using ITDEaSM to estimate the long-term impacts of global climate changes on the global-through-urban earth system, including air quality, water quality/supply, forest, and ecosystem.  Our ultimate goal is to quantify such impacts, reduce associated uncertainties, and identify technology choices for co-benefits of climate/Earth system mitigation. During this 1-year allocation time period, our work will focus on model improvement, testing, and initial applications, which will be conducted by 4 post-Ds and 8 graduate students in our project team.  A complex Earth system model like ITDEaSM requires significant high performance computing resources.  To achieve our goals, we request 5,000,000 SUs for computation (4,000,000 SUs on Kraken and 1,000,000 SUs on Ranger) and 50,000 SUs for Nautilus. ",

Extension will also be made to study hurricane track and intensity forecasts and their sensitivity to initial and boundary conditions. The grants that supported the research for which supercomputing time is sought in this proposal are listed in the cover page. As a continuation of the experiments of 2007, CAPS seeks resources to perform realtime storm-scale ensemble prediction with increased sophistication that is supported by LEAD and CSTAR grants, and to produce realtime numerical prediction of thunderstorms assimilating data from the CASA radar network. The latter is essential to fulfill the mission of NSF ERC CASA program. In addition, on-demand forecasts will be performed by LEAD across the Teragrid resources.

Large-eddy simulations (LES) has been used for process-scale simulations under idealized conditions, such as fixed wind speed and direction, and constant static stability. It is difficult to compare results of such idealized simulations with observations because atmospheric conditions are dynamically evolving in time, due to the diurnal variation. Another source for dichotomy between observations and simulations is that computational studies are very often carried out for a single isolated turbine, or for infinitely-large wind farms leading to the fully-developed wind-turbine array boundary layer. Field observations, however, are for large but finite-sized wind farms, where the number of turbines is at most of the order of a few hundreds. \n\nThe primary aim of this work is to study the performance of a large, finite-sized wind farm under realistic atmospheric forcing using LES. The Firewheel Wind Energy Complex (FWEC) will serve as the primary testbed. This wind farm which is currently under development on the Oklahoma-Texas border is projected to be one of the largest wind farms in the world with over 1200 horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWTs) and will serve as a primary energy source for the Plains and Eastern Clean Line, a new concept for long-distance, high-voltage DC transmission. Our partners in this project, Map Royalty, Inc. are leading the development at the FWEC, and have provided us with historical meteorological data from that site. A computational allocation to perform numerical simulations, informed by the available historical meteorological data, at unprecedented resolutions, would be a unique opportunity to study realistic flow physics of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and the wind farm.",

The largest uncertainty in quantifying the radiative impacts of human emissions on the present and historical climate is caused by the interaction of aerosols with clouds. From a computational modeling standpoint, the main challenge is the multi-scale nature of the problem. Conventional global climate models rely heavily on suboptimal parameterization of cloud-scale processes. On the other hand, global simulations that resolve cloud-scale processes are still prohibitively expensive. \n \nIn this XRAC proposal, we address this problem by combining the strengths of a multi-scale model and machine learning techniques to better advance our understanding of aerosol-cloud interactions. We will run the multi-scale Ultra-Parameterized Community Atmosphere Model (UPCAM) that embeds large-eddy resolution cloud resolving models within larger domain climate model columns and train a neural network with the model output to leverage machine learning techniques to estimate the impact of aerosols on cloud radiative properties. First, we will catalogue present-day aerosol-cloud relationships using UPCAM simulations. Second, we will compare simulations with present-day and pre-industrial emissions of aerosols to quantify the impact of anthropogenic aerosol emissions on cloud properties. Third, a neural network will be trained on the output from the UPCAM simulations to test the viability of the neural network predicting the effect of anthropogenic aerosol emissions on cloud properties.",

Specifically, ~750,000 SUs are requested in such clusters as Lonestar, Abe, and Steele.\nMotivated by the growing ability to experimentally produce particles of almost any imaginable shape in the nano- to micro-size range, the goal of this proposal is to apply molecular simulation methods to study the dynamic properties of disordered and partially ordered phases (mesophases) of systems containing cuboidal particles. This goal lies within the scope of nanotechnology that seeks to achieve greater control of order innanoscale objects via the use of both self-assembly properties and external forces (like shear). The models used are coarse-grained representations of colloidal particles whose effective inter-particle interactions can be tuned by surface-functionalization or by the composition of the solvent media. \nBased on the results of past Monte Carlo equilibrium simulations, it is expected that many of the suspensionswill exhibit a liquid-crystalline phase in between the isotropic phase (at low concentrations) and crystal phase (at high concentrations). To elucidate how particles and defects move in such phases, molecular dynamic simulations will be performed to track and characterize their motion at equilibrium conditions and under steady shear-flow. The mesophases may exhibit unusual shear response like shear thickening and yield stress.  \nThis work is complementary to experimental efforts by collaborators who are trying to realize the predicted novel phases and test their mechanical and rheological properties.In the long term, our results could impact the ceramic, plastics, and semiconductor industries by helping broaden the approaches available to develop strong nanocomposites with high particle loadings, sieves with regular topology, liquid armors, colloid-based mesocrystals for light control in photonic materials, sensors and stress-sensitive lubricants sensitive and nanocrystal arrays for photovoltaics\n",

Moreover, in the determination of thermal transport in metallic materials, electron-phonon coupling from DFT calculations will also be considered within Boltzmann transport equations for more effective rendering of accurate results.

In our group we have carried out research on SiC, the group-III nitrides (e.g. GaN), a related family of II-IV-N2 nitrides (e.g. ZnGeN2), ZnO and most recently Ga2O3. Defects play a dominant role for the semiconducting, optical, and other properties of these materials. Our research has as goals to calculate the energies of formation of defects and from them the equilibrium position of the Fermi level in the gap and the defect concentrations, the transition levels of different charge states of the defects and the defect level positions involved in optical transitions.  Uniquely we also study the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) parameters: the g-tensor and hyperfine interactions, which provide a powerful way to identify defects experimentally. We use the Gauge Including Projector Augmented Wave (GIPAW) method which is integrated with the Quantum Espresso (QE) software. The most recent version of QE has significantly improved with respect to parallel implementations and uses hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelism with Eigenvalue Solvers for Petaflop-Applications (ELPA). This version of QE was tested in our group  and showed very efficient parallel performance. We are requesting a Startup account to further study various defects and defect complexes  of current interest in Ga2O3, LiGaO2, ZnGeN2 and ZnO.

The unique electronic structure of graphene gives rise to many outstanding features and broad potential applications. However, the lack of a finite band gap is a big obstacle for the application of graphene on practical microelectronic devices because the intrinsic-graphene-based transistor cannot be switched off by the controlling voltage. Therefore, how to generate a finite band gap and, moreover, how to control the band gap are urgent and important research tasks.\n\nExperimental and theoretical studies have shown a few approaches to modify the electronic structure and band gap of graphene and bilayer graphene. We will focus on two of them; one is the chemical adsorption of molecules onto the graphene sheet; the other one is applying electric field to induce a finite band gap in bilayer graphene. For the first research topic, we plan to carry out first-principles studies to reveal how the molecules are adsorbed by graphene at the quantum-mechanics level and discover what kind of patterns these molecules prefer to form. For the second research topic, we will perform the first-principles calculation to study how the applied electric field induces a finite band gap in bilayer graphene. Many-electron effects will be included for the first time. Through this study we expect to explain the discrepancy between the prior theoretical calculations and experimental measurements and explore how important many-electron effects are in the electronic structure of two-dimensional semimetals. Finally, the change of the electronic structure induced by above methods will definitely have impact on the optical response of graphene and bilayer graphene. We plan to study optical absorption spectra of bilayer graphene under an applied electric field with many-electron effects included. Through this study, we hope to understand how electron-hole interactions modify the infrared optical absorption spectra of bilayer graphene with a finite band gap.\n\nIn order to realize above research plans, a powerful and efficient parallelized computing platform is of importance. Therefore, we write this proposal to TeraGrid for necessary computing allocation. We believe that these proposed plans will not only improve our understanding of the electronic structure and optical response of graphene but also significantly contribute to practical applications of this novel material. Moreover, our research plans will benefit the computational condensed matter research community in Washington University and St. Louis region and provide excellent opportunities for researchers to learn attractive properties of graphene and many-electron effects on nanostructures.\n",

The resource request is for an amount of 8 million CPU-hours,\nor 167,000SUs on the Stampede2 SKX cluster. The purpose of the research is to obtain well-\nresolved numerical data on spray and droplet formation, transport and entrainment into the\natmosphere resulting from the breaking action of the wave. This phenomenon, along with the\ncomplementary process of bubble entrainment, constitutes an important but poorly understood\npart of climate dynamics, and is responsible to a large degree for the energy transfer between\nthe ocean and the atmosphere. The simulations will be conducted using the Basilisk code to\nsolve the viscous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in water and air, modelling surface\ntension. Basilisk is the successor of the proven Gerris Flow Solver, which has previously been\nused for problems of this kind to great eect. Scaling exercises have been performed by the PI on\nan XSEDE startup grant on the requested cluster, among others, which informs the requested\namount of SUs. This project will be undertaken by the PI at the Mechanical & Aerospace\nEngineering Department at Princeton University, in the research group led by L. Deike.

We will develop a suite of eddy-resolving process simulations with steep bottom topography. These will be used to analyze various dynamical aspects of mesoscale turbulence over steep slopes, such as the inverse energy cascade and routes to dissipation of momentum and energy. We will use these simulations to develop and test a new parametrization of eddy transport and mixing over steep slopes.\n\nThe goal of (ii) is to develop a high-resolution regional ocean/sea ice model of the Weddell Sea, allowing us to analyze the relative influences of tides, eddies and larger- scale currents on water mass transport and transformation in a site that is critical for the global ocean overturning circulation. Specifically, we will use the model output identify the relative roles of tides and eddies in transporting water masses across the continental slope, in moving water masses around the continental shelf, and in mixing and entrainment between these water masses.",

Topology optimization is a physics-based computational design method that can automatically generate structural layout for optimal performances. Topology optimization of conjugate heat transfer systems such as heat sinks is computationally expensive. The optimization process typically involves hundreds of iterations. In each iteration, it needs to solve coupled Navier-Stokes fluid equations and advection-diffusion thermal equations. Our preliminary implementation of our optimization package has been run on an 80-core node through our campus clusters. The goal of using XSEDE resource (Stampede2) is two-fold: 1) reducing discovery time, i.e. using super-computer resource to accelerate the computational process for discovering optimal shape and topology for best convective heat transfer, and 2) improving design resolutions and their thermofluid performances such as heat transfer rate and pressure drop. In topology optimization, minimal feature size of the resulting designs depends critically on the mesh resolution. Thus, higher mesh resolution enabled by XSEDE resource would result in finer features, which would in turn lead to structures with better heat transfer and less pressure drop.",

The CMS Collaboration co-discovered the Higgs boson in 2012, has provided constraints on many models of new physics, and has made many precise measurements of the properties of known particles. 661 scientific papers have been submitted to date. The collaboration is now actively analyzing data recorded in 2016 and 2017, with an emphasis on searches for dark matter and supersymmetric particles and measurements of the properties of the Higgs boson. The prompt delivery of scientific results depends on the availability of computing resources that are capable of performing extensive simulations of physics processes in short amounts of time. The full suite of CMS physics measurements requires the simulation of billions of proton-proton collision events, including both processes that would arise from new, speculative physics models and those that arise from standard model processes that would be the background to the new physics.  We propose to use XSEDE resources at Stampede2, Bridges and Comet for the simulation of one billion collision events during the first quarter of 2018.  Not only will this provide 10\\% of the simulations needed during this quarter for the work of the global collaboration in performing dozens of physics measurements, it will also allow us to demonstrate the use of XSEDE resources at very large scales in preparation for meeting the needs of CMS at the planned High Luminosity LHC.",

This is evident from the large number of publications, in prestigious neuroscience journals, that are more and more based on modeling in the field of neuroscience. This has motivated development of parallel simulation environments such as NEURON, GENESIS3, MOOSE, NEST, Brian and PyNN. During this same time there has been significant development of Cyberinfrastructure resources consisting of High Performance Computing (HPC) machines, fast networks, next generation data and storage technologies and software that can create and manage complex workflow, automatically run parallel simulations, and handle data/output retrieval/transfer. The more complex neuroscience problems, which involve network models, optimization or exploration of high dimensional parameter spaces etc., require access to HPC machines and data storage. Access to national scale CI/HPC can help broaden the base of students and researchers, who can attempt to learn and use computational neuroscience even if a first class HPC center does not exist at their own university or college. Yet accessing and using HPC resources remain difficult for neuro-scientists due to the need to (i) write convincing allocation proposals, (ii) understand complex HPC architectures, (iii) master complex OS/software environment, (iv) optimally install neuronal simulation software, (v) learn policies and batch system environments, (vi) manage data transfer and retrieval, and (vii) understand remote authentication process. This project involves building a Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) and providing it as a service which will simplify the CI/HPC environment and reduce the barrier to access and use HPC resources for neuro-scientists. Similar gateways have been successfully developed for other fields such as nano technology, phylogenetics, bioinformatics, chemistry, weather prediction etc. and allow utilization of XSEDE HPC resources extremely efficiently by large number of gateways users. The proposed NSG gateway will provide optimally installed parallel neuronal software (NEURON, GENESIS3, MOOSE, NEST, Brian and PyNN) on HPC resources of Trestles and Lonestar for which we request the allocation. We expect that, following the success of other science gateways, this NSG will allow large number of neuro-scientists easily and efficiently use these parallel neuronal software on XSEDE HPC resources and enable, enhance and broaden computational neuroscience research and education. The sited NSF Advances in Biological Informatics (ABI) grant, from the NSF Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI), to the PI and one of the Co-PIs of this allocation proposal will be basis for the development of this NSG. Preliminary parallel scaling study has been done using the Startup and associated Supplemental allocation. And we have also analyzed the usage of the 300K (Startup and Supplemental) SUs by the NSG users and based on that requested allocation in this XRAC proposal. We are requesting allocation on both the Trestles and the Lonestar machines on which we also received the initial Startup allocation and all of that allocation was used up by the NSG users. Neuro-scientists will be simulating lot larger and more complex neuronal models than the ones which were run on the Triton and Lonestar cluster for benchmark purposes and hence we expect larger core count parallel jobs being run using the requested allocation.",

                    "project_abstract": "Computational Anatomy is a discipline focused on the quantitative analysis of the variability in biological shape. Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) is the key algorithm, which assigns computable descriptors of anatomical shapes and a metric distance between them. This is achieved by describing populations of anatomy as a group of diffeomorphic transformations applied to a template, and using a metric on the space of diffeomorphisms. LDDMM is being used extensively in the neuroimaging (\\url{www.mristudio.org}) and cardiovascular imaging (\\url{www.cvrgrid.org}) communities. Modern high resolution scanners are producing images which require the computational power of multiple processing units. One of our goals is to analyze the high-resolution images on large memory (1TB memory) machines with the existing openMP implementation of LDDMM. The initial startup year was extremely successful in meeting our goals and a science gateway has been created. The Computational Anatomy Science Gateway (\\url{https://www.xsede.org/gateways-listing}) is established to support neuroimaging community. In this year, we plan to continue with development and expansion of the science gateway role to support these two communities. The neuroimaging community (\\url{www.mristudio.org}) that this gateway will support has 6000 users, who are beginning to transfer to our science gateway model, while we continue to expand our user base. Our local cluster has processed over 47K brains since 2009 which required 450K CPU-hrs on 8 core nodes with 32GB of memory. Over the past year we have begun to offload the majority of jobs from our local cluster to XSEDE resources. The gateway is enabling the processing of large populations in parallel on multiple cores. With these new data sets, innovations in software optimization, and algorithms that benefit from statistical knowledge of populations are being explored. Significant development with GPGPUs has occured, and we hope to further exploit the Xeon Phi co-processors in the same manner. In addition to the neuroimaging community, the cardiovascular community (\\url{www.cvrgrid.org}) will also utilize the gateway for shape analysis (\\url{http://cvrgrid.org/features/cardiac-c}) in the future if resources allow.",

Many extreme climate events affecting the US and other countries surrounding the Atlantic, such as hurricanes and severe flood and drought events, are influenced by conditions in the Atlantic Ocean. It is therefore imperative to have accurate simulations of the climatic mean and variability in the Atlantic region to be able to make credible projections of future climate change affecting the US and other countries adjoining the Atlantic Ocean. Unfortunately, current-generation IPCC-class climate models exhibit severe biases in their simulations of tropical Atlantic climate. An infamous symptom of the Atlantic biases is the persistent warm sea-surface temperature (SST) bias of more than 6C off the coast of Namibia and Angola, which severely hampers our ability to accurately simulate and project impacts of global climate change in the region. This research focuses on improving our current understanding of causes of the biases, leading to major improvements in simulation and projection of future climate change within the Atlantic sector and beyond. \n\nIntellectual Merit. The research outlined in this proposal will significantly extend previous understanding of tropical Atlantic biases in a number of ways: 1) oceanic contributions to the biases will be assessed and sources will be identified through a combined analysis of observations, ocean reanalysis products, Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) model simulations and eddy-resolving regional ocean simulations; 2) atmospheric contributions to the biases will be evaluated by a comparative analysis of atmospheric reanalysis data and convection-resolving regional atmospheric model simulations; 3) the role of ocean-atmosphere interactions in amplifying the oceanic or atmospheric biases will be examined by conducting high-resolution coupled regional climate model (CRCM) simulations. The use of high-resolution (up to 3 km) regional climate models allows explicitly resolving oceanic mesoscale eddies, fronts and upwelling dynamics off the west coast of southern Africa, as well as atmospheric convection and steep orography effects, and thus minimizes model systematic errors due to uncertainties associated with parameterizations of subgrid-scale processes. This modeling approach also isolates sources of the biases from other ocean basins and helps to pinpoint the causes of the biases within the Atlantic basin. It further facilitates a better model-data comparison as recent intense observational programs within the Atlantic sector have together produced an array of fine temporal and spatial resolution data sets that require high-resolution model simulations to fully utilize their advantages. Furthermore, the proposal is timely, because it coincides with the launch of two major European research projects in the study region, i.e., the German project Southwest African Coastal Upwelling System and Benguela Nio (SACUS) led by Brandt and the EU project Enhancing prediction of tropical Atlantic climate and its impacts (PREFACE) led by Keenlyside, both of which are expected to generate new arrays of observations along the southern Africa coast. If funded, we anticipate close collaboration with the European colleagues throughout the project. Combining the new observations with the detailed modeling approach, we expect new breakthroughs in solving tropical Atlantic bias problems.\n\nBroader Impacts.  The research will enhance our understanding of the uncertainties in projecting impacts of global climate change in the Atlantic region, which has enormous socio-economic implications for countries in the region. The CRCM is being developed within the framework of the Coupler (CPL7) software that is part of the NCAR Community Earth System Model (CESM). This framework allows us to easily port parameterizations between CESM and the CRCM, and potentially allow partial coupling between the CESM and the CRCM.  We envision that the CRCM will become a community-modeling tool and be made available to the broader climate research community. Findings from this study on reducing climate model biases will feedback to community model development activities. The project will support one graduate student and one postdoc at Texas A&M University (TAMU) and provide valuable professional development for all young scientists, including Co-PI Patricola, involved in the program.\n",

                    "project_abstract": "The numerical simulations proposed here are aimed at calculating accurate Linear Response Functions (LRFs) of Global Climate Models (GCMs). Calculating accurate LRFs of GCMs has been actively pursued in the past four decades by the climate science community because of the broad applications of such LRFs. However, obtaining accurate LRFs has been found challenging, mainly because turbulence, which plays a key role in the dynamics of atmospheric and oceanic circulations, is poorly understood. The proposed research has two objectives:\n\nObjective 1: To calculate accurate LRFs for several model setups of a widely used atmospheric GCM by employing a method recently developed by the PI. This method will be referred to as the Green's Function (GRF) method. The PI used the GRF method to accurately calculate the LRF of this GCM for one model setup. This accurate LRF has been used to study several problems related to extreme weather events and internal climate variability. Calculating the accurate LRFs for several model setups will allow us to study a wider range of important problems in climate dynamics.\n\nObjective 2: The main drawback of the GRF method is that it is computationally demanding. The second objective is to investigate whether any data-driven method can produce the LRFs with accuracy comparable to that of the GRF method but at a lower computational cost. The performance of several data-driven methods has been found to be poor by various researchers in the past, but the reason(s) behind the poor performance (i.e., low accuracy) is unknown. Another application of the accurate LRFs calculated using the GRF method is that they can be used to identify the source(s) of the poor performance of data-driven methods, as recently demonstrated by PI.",

                    "project_abstract": "There is ample evidence that dynamical models of the Earth's climate system have the potential to make skillful seasonal predictions of the Indian summer monsoon rainfall from May to September. Currently, however, there is still a major gap between the level of predictability and actual prediction skill, which can be attributed to both inadequate model physics and inaccurate initial state. This proposal requests computational resource to improve the seasonal monsoon prediction, using the version 2 of the Climate Forecast System (CFSv2), which is the current operational climate prediction model at the National Centers for Environmental Predictions. We concentrate on improving the ocean initialization of the forecast system, where most of the memory for seasonal predictability resides. For this purpose, we will conduct a set of 28-year (1979-2009) hindcast experiments, using our newly developed strategy of multiple analysis ensemble (MAE) initialization of ocean. It is expected that the MAE strategy will significantly reduce the effect of the inherent uncertainty in current ocean analyses and thus improve the seasonal prediction skill of the sea surface temperature (SST) in not only the tropical eastern Pacific, but also the western Pacific and Indian Oceans, which will further lead to improved Indian Monsoon prediction. A set of the idealized initialization experiments will also be conducted to help evaluate the effects of the model systematic bias. Furthermore, some sensitivity experiments will be conducted to examine the relative contributions to the monsoon prediction by the SST anomalies in the tropical Pacific, Indian and Atlantic basins respectively, as well as the influences of the atmospheric model resolution on the tropical air-sea interaction. The total requested computational allocation for these experiments is 4.30 million core-hours (su) on Stampede. ",

A new approach to design that embraces the atomistic, quantum mechanical nature of the constituent materials is necessary to develop more powerful yet energy miserly devices. \n\nElectronic device engineering and material science must meet at the atomic scale to design new switching concepts. This demands the solution of quantum non-equilibrium statistical mechanics in systems in excess of 107 complex degrees of freedom. Computations of this magnitude have been impossible, due to the lack of sufficiently powerful computers. Petascale computing creates an opportunity to pursue a multi-scale design approach that fuses nano scale (atomic) to the macro scale (wire), which will make possible new kinds of device designs that were previously unimaginable. We propose to develop a general-purpose simulation engine. It will model out-of-equilibrium electron transport in realistically extended devices using fully quantum mechanical (QM) models in an atomistic material description containing millions of atoms. Using this new approach, designers can directly address questions of quantization and spin, tunneling, phonon interactions, and heat generation. \n\nIt is widely accepted that the Non-Equilibrium Green Function Formalism (NEGF) QM statistical mechanics theory, in conjunction with an atomistic basis, can answer these questions. It is also widely perceived that the problem is too hard to solve. The PI Klimeck developed NEMO 1-D, the first NEGF-based commercial-grade device simulator, and NEMO 3-D, which calculates electronic structure (no NEGF) for systems larger than 52 million atoms. The codes have been shown to scale to more than 23,000 / 8,192 cores, respectively, on TOP500 machine numbers 2, 7, 8, 30, and 46. We propose to extend the NEGF capabilities of NEMO 1-D with the NEMO 3-D electronic structure description to form the next generation device and materials engineering toolkit OMEN. The necessary levels of parallelism to tackle the problem on 200,000+ CPUs have been designed and demonstrated to scale well. Computer scientists and HPC experts embedded in the team will guide the implementation and explore performance, execution reliability, and alternative hardware and algorithms. \n\nThis research and development has been funded through a PetaApps award by NSF. This proposal highlights the scaling results we currently have available and indicates why we are requesting a large resource allocation from the TeraGrid.\n",

The solutions of sparse linear systems of equations dominate the execution time of many scientific simulation codes. As the number of cores and threads increase, many large distributed solvers will have larger domains that need to be solved concurrently. However, energy and resilience are becoming a larger concern as dynamic power approaches static power making the issue of building new solvers even more difficult, and our goal is to better understand these two factors in order to try to achieve a linear time solver by means of approximation.  To better understand resilience, energy, and performance, observation will be made to solve methods that use some kind of approximation, e.g., mixed precision or approximate cache loads.  Models are to be constructed from these observations to build a relationship between resilience, energy, and performance.  From the understanding gained, we will construct prototype solver packages that can be used by the high performance computing community to improve their simulation codes. In order to complete this work, we request access to varies different systems in order to make observation and build the prototype solver packages. This request amounts to 2000su on Stampede2, 40000su on Bridges Regular Memory, and 500su on Bridges GPU.

At both short-term (e.g., seconds) and long-term (millions of years), a wide range of observations suggest the Earth's lithosphere undergoes deformation through a combination of highly non-linear brittle, viscoelastic and viscous deformation. Here, I propose to continue using state-of-the-art numerical simulations of 3D lithospheric deformation to constrain the impact of rheology on continental rifting (e.g., extension). Specifically, the first component of the proposed work will examine the impact of viscoelastic flexure on the evolution of 3D normal fault populations and individual fault growth. The remaining components of the proposed work will build directly on these models and examine the effects of pressure boundary conditions and extension obliquity. Significantly, the proposed simulations associated with these three topics are directly influenced either by previous 2D studies or detailed geologic observations in rifted margins. In all cases, the simulations will be run with open-source community software and made publicly available (software, model files, results) through journal archives or version control repositories. Combined, the results of the proposed simulations and their open availability to the community will advance our understanding of the key processes controlling continental rifting and allow the geodynamics to build directly on this work.",

The computational models are closely linked to a wide variety of observations, including seismicity, the seismic structure of the earths interior, the kinematics of plates and the geological evolution of the continents. This allocation covers three science topics covered in three proposals funded by the NSF.  First, we use time-dependent, spherical models of mantle convection that are closely linked to plate kinematic models. A key objective of this work is to understand the long-term topographic evolution of continents and sea-level change. We will also be able to use the outputs of these global models to better understand the dynamics of the lowermost mantle. Second, we use a new finite element model with multi-physics to look at the detailed dynamics of a process called subduction (this is the process when a plate is returned to the earths interior). Third, we will look at the initiation of subduction, a major unknown in plate tectonics. We have requested 9.4M SUs on the TACC Stampede platform and have demonstrated good to excellent parallel scaling for the two software packages that well be using.",

                    "project_abstract": "The hotspots that we observed on Earth\u00e2??s surface, such as the Hawaii, are often suggested to be caused by partial melting of mantle plumes. Mantle plumes typically form at Earth\u00e2??s thermal boundary layer, such as the core-mantle boundary (CMB). Being hot and buoyancy, mantle plumes could rise from the CMB to beneath the lithosphere. The impinging of mantle plumes on the lithosphere increases surface topography which is called dynamic topography. The density anomaly associated with the mantle plumes and the induced surface topography cause changes to the Earth\u00e2??s gravity fields. \n\nMantle plumes play a critical role in the Earth\u00e2??s evolution, including the long-term climate change. However, the physical properties of mantle plumes (e.g., size, temperature, density, and viscosity) remain not well constrained, which is partly due to the relatively small size of plumes that make them difficult to be imaged by seismic observations. This project proposes to use numerical modeling to build the relationships between the physical properties of the mantle plumes and the lithosphere and the surface expressions of mantle plumes, namely, the melt production, dynamic topography and geoid anomaly. We have previous developed methods to compute these observables from mantle convection models using our Startup Allocation in the past year. We here request 110,550 SUs and 5,790 GB storage on Stempede2 to apply our methods to systematically explore how physical properties of plumes and the lithosphere are linked to the surface expressions of mantle plumes. As we explained in the section 6 \u00e2??Justification of resources\u00e2?\u009d of the main document, these resources are essential to explore a reasonable scale of parameter space on our models.",

The programming model is sequential Java augmented with two constructs called optimistic set iterators.

However, chemical ecology is on the cusp of a revolution. Recent innovations in analytical chemistry and chemo- and bioinformatics make it possible to infer the molecular formulas and likely structures of thousands of unknown chemical compounds, and hence to study the chemical ecology of plants, and the organisms with which they interact, even in species-rich and understudied systems such as tropical forests.  As a beginning assistant professor in Integrative Biology at the University of Texas at Austin and soon-to-be research associate at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama, my research program seeks to ride the cutting edge of these developments in chemistry to rest fundamental hypotheses concerning the role of plant secondary metabolites in community ecology and evolution. My students, postdocs, collaborators, and I will take advantage of XSEDE computing resources to process liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) data to identify metabolites, infer molecular formulas, and predict molecular structures for compounds detected in plant tissue from >2000 tree species sampled in field sites around the world.  Many of our field sites are forest dynamics plots in the Smithsonian Forest Global Earth Observatory-Center for Tropical Forest Science (ForestGEO-CTFS) global network that range from subarctic boreal forest to hyperdiverse tropical rainforest.  Secondary metabolite data for these trees will be used to i) model the effect of secondary metabolites on performance and survival, and hence community dynamics, in forest dynamics plots spanning latitudinal, climatic, and diversity gradients, ii) infer the chemical variation that drives insect herbivore and microbial pathogen host-use patterns using statistical approaches based on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and machine learning, and iii) model the relationship between chemical evolution and lineage diversification/speciation in plant phylogenies.  This research agenda will require the use of open-source software as well as custom, home-brewed models, primarily in R.",

We wish to run these simulations using OpenFoam (an open-source CFD solver), for which user-defined functions will need to be created and compiled along with the source code. OpenFoam is highly parallelizable and scalable, so we would like to explore the feasibility of using this solver with a TACC startup allocation. We have generated approximately 30 patient-specific meshes of the aforementioned pulmonary arterial geometries. However, for startup resources we will use only one of the meshes to study the scalability of OpenFoam to solve this transient problem and evaluate the effects of time step size and number of periodic flow cycles needed to achieve time-independent results.",

Plasmonic gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) present a clear pink to dark red color, and change to blue, purple or black when getting close to each other due to plasmonic coupling, referred to as the plasmonic coupling assay (PCA). Similar to other rapid diagnostic tests, PCA is simple, fast, low-cost, but lacks sufficient sensitivity. So far gold nanospheres have been predominantly used for PCA due to the ease of synthesis and visible colorimetric shift. Our preliminary result suggests a 10-fold higher virus binding effectiveness using AuNRs than spherical AuNPs. Furthermore, it has been shown that silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have higher plasmonic absorption than AuNPs of same size and may give stronger plasmonic coupling. The overall goal of this study is to engineer nanoprobes with stronger plasmonic coupling strength and optimal coupling geometry, and test their diagnostic performance using digital nanobubble detection. We will design nanoprobes for optimal plasmonic coupling strength by systematically investigating various geometries and compositions through advance numerical modeling. Specifically, discrete dipole approximation (DDA) and Boundary element method (BEM) will be used to study the laser nanoparticle interaction. Then, Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation will be employed to investigate how laser energy is transferred to nanoparticle surrounding. These simulation need to be run on high performance computing facilities.",

The theory has been mostly applied to brittle fracture; its ability to predict ductile fracture has been mostly untested. Silling et al.

Shortcomings associated with the approach, such as the unphysical problem of matter interpenetration, were reported by Tupek and Radovitzky (2014). To address the issues, they extended the original theory by incorporating non-linear bond strain measures. Recently Foster and Xu (2018) generalized Tupek\u2019s model and presented a constitutive correspondence framework with kinematic variables (e.g. a nonlocal right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor) that can be applied directly to finite deformation plasticity. Although the model is currently limited to isotropic materials, its suitability for very large deformations over the previous peridynamic models appear to outweigh the shortcoming.

The goals of the multi-year project have been to develop improved algorithms for multiscale simulation, to test their performance while quantifying uncertainty in physicochemical mechanisms and associated parameter values, and to utilize the simulations to design improved systems. To accomplish this goal, we have examined experimental data with sensitivity analysis, parameter estimation, and model selection tools. The initial physical application chosen for study was the copper electrodeposition processes for fabricating on-chip wiring interconnections between transistors, especially the role of trace amounts of additives that are critically important. In this proposal, new PIs are added that expand the range of numerical simulation methods as well as the physical applications.  The requested computational resources are for 1,966,860 SUs on the NCSA Xeon Linux Cluster (Abe/QueenBee).

The computational effort described in this request includes deterministic as well as stochastic techniques separately and, by linking them, enables multi-scale investigations of varying electrochemical interactions and applications.\n\nWe have pursued a multi-prong approach for accelerating the stochastic algorithms and the deterministic simulations, in addition to use of parallelization. Improved algorithms and code linkages developed during 2004-06 made it possible to tackle significantly more difficult applications which, during 2007-08, were targeted on early stages of electrochemical nucleation, growth, and coalescence of metal nanoclusters and thin films on various surfaces. Such phenomena occur at time and length scales that are hundreds of times smaller than the previous applications, giving rise to issues of numerical stiffness, mesh refinement, and need for accelerated methods. In addition during 2007-08, we created a new generation of algorithms along with a new generation of systems in which simulation predictions could be compared with experimental data for parameter estimation and model validation. Throughout these successive generations of studies, the overall strategy has been to use parameter sensitivity, parameter estimation, and model discrimination techniques to select the hypothesis that most likely describes experimentally-observed phenomena. Parameter sensitivity simulations, used for both parameter estimation and model selection techniques, focus on obtaining the key fundamental parameters from large sets of experimental data. In addition to the above studies, as part of this effort, we consider other electrochemical systems such as transport (electrical and chemical transport) through synthetic nanopores and electrochemical phenomena at solid-liquid interfaces. Our multiscale method development for these applications is based on (i) hierarchical integration of quantum, atomistic, mesoscale, and classical continuum theories and (ii) quasi-continuum theories where interatomic potentials are directly integrated into the continuum theories.\n\nIn this TRAC renewal proposal, we will focus on (i) improved coarse-graining methods for accurate and rapid parameter sensitivity and parameter estimation methods for electrochemical nucleation, growth, and other applications, (ii) optimization of entire complex systems composed of previously-developed multi-scale algorithms, and (iii) application of these methods to a different electrochemical systems &#8213; lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors, synthetic ion channels, and functional surfaces. The extension to new systems will demonstrate that the algorithm and simulation developments carried out to date are also characteristic of a large class of systems where controlled shape evolution is exploited to produce desired structures. Such characteristics are ubiquitous in nanotechnology, biotechnology, and materials &#8213; where manufacturing processes must ensure quality control at the molecular scale. The algorithms and software are generic over a broad class of problems, and will contribute well beyond the applications used in their development. The availability of such computational tools will accelerate fundamental scientific research as well as engineering design.",

Our FSI framework must handle the coupling of complex fluid flows, large structural deformations, contact problems, and geometric variability inherent to heart valves. By using techniques of isogeometric analysis, we will be able to directly analyze spline-based representations of valves. Creating a robust, accurate, and dynamical simulation of valvular FSI will allow us to study the effects of leaflet geometry and material properties on blood flow patterns, and investigate time dependent phenomena such as fatigue damage of bioprosthetic heart valves, where the leaflet properties change over the course of many cycles. We plan to validate our FSI model by comparing computational results to experimental data.",

The significance of double-diffusive mixing for water-mass transformation and determining the structure of the temperature-salinity relationship in all oceans has become increasingly clear over the last few years. One of the most intriguing aspects of double-diffusive convection is related to its ability to transform smooth vertical gradients into stepped structures consisting of mixed layers separated by thin, stratified interfaces. Recent field data from the tropical Atlantic has shown that vertical fluxes due to salt fingers, within thermohaline staircases, are significantly (by an order of magnitude) enhanced when compared to non-staircase regions with similar stratifications. Thus, it is vital to improve our understanding of thermohaline staircase formation, evolution and large-scale consequences. Double-diffusive mixing plays a fundamental role in the oceans ability to transport and sequester heat, salt, nutrients, pollutants and carbon dioxide. Yet, this small-scale process is not included in most large-scale oceanographic models, including operational Navy models, which severely limits their predictive capabilities. This research plan is aimed at quantifying the double-diffusive transport in both smooth gradients and thermohaline staircases, developing clear insight into the origin of staircases and specifying conditions for their formation. The proposed study will involve numerical process modeling using a pseudo-spectral code, which integrates the Navier-Stokes equations of motion (Boussinesq approximation). Inferences from the model runs will be used to interpret the oceanic fine- and microstructure data and the results of laboratory experiments. Advanced support is requested for collaboration with Dr. Gabriele Jost, who is familiar with the double-diffusive codes and has collaborated with the NPS computational fluid dynamics group in the past. This collaboration involves application of the advanced numerical methods to Double-Diffusion problems. The goal of this collaboration is to perform a series of Direct Numerical Simulations that will form the basis of a parameterization scheme for the General Circulation Models (GCMs). Prof Radko has developed code of his own to solve DDC problems for 2D (SF2D) and 3D (SF3D) problems. The parallelization in these codes is based on OpenMP. In order to handle realistic problem sizes, more computational power is needed than what the current OpenMP version delivers on general multi-core node clusters. SF3D lends itself to MPI parallelization. The 2D version (SF2D) may be a good candidate for running on GPGPU based nodes. Special support is requested for the port of SF2D to a GPGPU system, the development of an MPI based version of SF3D and for the evaluation of existing MPI-based codes and their suitability to the current project.",

In the optical absorption experiment, we observed that the absorption is strongly enhanced when the thickness of WS2 film increases via longer W sputtering time. In the same sample, we also find that the interlayer spacing reduces in the deep region of the film. In the W-rich condition the S vacancy and W substitution vacancy is readily created, inducing the reduction of interlayer spacing and band gap at the same time. Using DFT calculation, we investigate the effect of the defect to WS2, explaining the experimental results and broadening the understanding of defect states in WS2.",

                    "project_abstract": "Atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are frequently used to evaluate the structure of intermediate (1-100 kDa) proteins, especially those exhibiting well-defined globular morphologies. However, validation of protein structures is often limited to global comparisons to static experimental structures, despite fluctuations in solution NMR that indicate that solvent-exposed amino acids interconvert between states in a thermodynamic ensemble. While it is well known that amino acids in globular cores remain tightly packed together, we recently identified a fixed percolation geometry in these regions that also persists in the presence of small mutations or thermal fluctuations. This key observation enables us to implement a novel technique that quickly validates physiological and pathological protein structures from MD, in addition to predicting putative structures based on the conservation of core residue percolation. Compared to traditional enhanced-sampling methods, where protein conformations are extracted from the most probable states, the use of side-chain percolation allows decoy states to be filtered out and discarded. As a result, simulations can focus on states that are thermodynamically consistent with known experimental ensembles, rather than on a singular protein fold. In order to develop this technique into a widely-utilized tool for efficient protein folding, we propose the following two projects: (1) to measure how often proteins implicated in physiological and pathological processes interconvert between known conformations as a result of MD fluctuations, and whether such fluctuations vary across popular force fields. (2) to identify how conformational mutations affect the interconversion between physiological and pathological states while conserving globular percolation, especially in the context of cancer and Alzheimer\u00e2??s Disease. Taken as a whole, the ability to filter true protein structures from energy-minimized decoys will greatly reduce the need for very long protein folding simulations and can inform how proteins pathological misfold within their thermodynamic limitations.",

Compared with previous studies, we have two major advantages in obtaining more accurate seismic images: (1) an unprecedented station coverage in our study area with ambient noise data recorded by more than 800 stations and an inter-station spacing of a few to a few tens of kilometers; (2) an adjoint tomography technique based on highly accurate spectral-element method to simulate empirical Greens functions derived from ambient noise interferometry. Our main research objectives focus on providing a more refined 3D wavespeed crustal model to better understand the evolution history and current deformation mechanism of the study region. There are a few scientific questions to be answered with the new model: (1) What is the geometry of the low velocity zones (LVZs)? Are the LVZs horizontally pervasive or more complex? Are the LVZs spatially related to the fault zones and why? (2) Is there a correlation between major fault zones and regions with sharp wavespeed contrast? (3) Is there any robust seismological footprint (e.g. high wavespeed lower crust) to prove the existence of the mantle plume, which may have played an important role in generating the Emeishan basalts?",

Specifically, the PI will (i) formulate layered-medium Green functions and generalized conductor loss models for packages to simplify modeling/meshing, to increase accuracy, and to reduce number of unknowns, (ii) develop FFT-accelerated iterative and direct integral-equation algorithms to reduce computational costs, (iii) devise parallel workload distribution methods to increase parallel efficiency and scalability of the methods, and (iv) deploy the resulting software and investigate its performance on massively parallel clusters of multi-core processors and many-integrated-core coprocessors on Lonestar and Stampede.\nThe requested SUs will be used for (i) code validation by solving reference problems, (ii) parallel scalability tests, and (iii) medium-scale simulations. It is expected that the results of these investigation will significantly extend our ability to quantify the elecrtical performance of electronic packages.",

Non-spherical, superficially porous particles (SPP) are a possibility for improving separation efficiency without further reducing the particle length scale. This research will investigate the chromatographic efficiency of ellipsoidal and spherocylindrical particles in HPLC, using pore-scale simulation methods capable of resolving flow and transport in microporous SPP.  The methods include computer algorithms for three-dimensional particle packing, viscous flow through the pore spaces of the packing, and time-dependent hydrodynamic dispersion of solutes in the flowing solvent. The methods will be applied within a general experimental design that will consider the parameters of particle shape, superficial porosity, particle orientation with respect to flow, packing volume fraction, and applied pressure drop, focusing on parameter value ranges of likely industrial significance. The experimental outcomes of broadest \nsignificance include the chromatographic efficiency (plate height vs velocity) and impedence (plate height vs pressure drop).",

                    "project_abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating disease without effective treatment. The chronic SCI remains the most difficult to treat. The pathologic hallmarks in chronic SCI include increased astrogliosis and inhibitory molecules that hinder axonal regeneration.  However, the understanding of the detailed molecular pathways is still very limited. For example, how inhibitory molecules are regulated and maintained in the chronic phase remains unclear. Current therapeutics for gliosis is not ideal, and new molecular targets are urgently needed. Previous studies have usually focused on a small number of genes and pathways at a time, and thus did not provide a comprehensive view of the complex mechanisms underlying SCI pathophysiology. Although, during the last decade, microarray studies have provided valuable insights into SCI, microarray suffers from limitations in resolution, dynamic range and accuracy. Recent advances in RNA-Sequencing technology, make it possible to globally map transcribed regions and quantitatively analyze expression at an unprecedented level of sensitivity and specificity. Based on our preliminary studies of differential expression using RNA-Seq during acute and subacute SCI phases in mouse contusive injury models, we propose to investigate the intricate relationship of genes and pathways in the spinal cord tissue and the predominant component of the glial scar (purified astrocytes) in chronic SCI by using integrated RNA-Seq and network analyses. We hypothesize that novel genes and pathways that regulate or maintain inhibitory molecules in reactive astrocytes (chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans, tenascins, ephrin-B2 and Slit proteins etc.) are critical for the chronic SCI inhibitory environment associated with glial scar. Specifically, we propose to derive a better understanding of the progression of SCI pathophysiology by characterizing gene and splicing isoform changes in SCI subchronic/chronic phases at both temporal and spatial levels. Additionally, we will use an innovative strategy of integrated network analysis to identify novel genes of interest (GOIs) and pathways involved in gliosis as new molecular targets. We will also incorporate pharmacogenomic information into our analyses that will serve as a powerful tool for translation. Finally, we will test GOIs potentially involved in neuron inhibition of reactive astrocytes by loss- and gain-of-function assays in a glia scar model for their functional effects.\nOur study is the first to propose that the mechanisms of chronic SCI and gliosis be investigated at the systems level using RNA-Seq, and key genes be identified via innovative pathway and network analyses and be tested by functional assays.  The advantage of the genome-wide analysis is that, as a de novo discovery approach, it can identify critical missing links in the disease processes that were not previously appreciated. Importantly, we will generate a comprehensive data resource of SCI gene expression which will be extremely valuable for the research community (jiaqianwulab.org/SCIbrowser/data). The successful completion of this project will lead to the discovery of novel molecular targets and shift the research and clinical paradigms.",

Although coastal areas are predominantly at risk from storm surge flooding, areas along the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries are also extremely vulnerable to hurricane flooding. It is believed that coastal wetlands, besides its ecological importance, might help to reduce the impact of storm surge, acting as a natural protection against hurricane flooding, especially for small hurricanes and tropical storms. Here, we propose to develop a novel framework integrating high performance computing of hurricane storm surge flooding, hydrodynamics characterization of flow through natural wetlands ecosystems and critical infrastructure inventory to investigate the potential of wetlands to reduce hurricane flooding, improving our basic understanding of natural hazards and our capability to expand the State resilience to such events. To improve our fundamental knowledge of tide and storm surge hydrodynamics in wetlands ecosystems, four study sites in the eastern shore will be equipped with sensors to thoroughly monitor water levels within wetlands ecosystems and field survey will be performed in these sites to measure vegetation structural characteristics contributing to flow resistance (i.e. height, diameter and stem density). The field campaigns information will support the development and calibration of computational models to simulate storm surge flow over wetlands specifically designed to represent Virginias aquatic vegetation. A multi-model, multi-scale, multi-resolution approach will be developed to integrate High Performance Computing (HPC) of large scale and high resolution hurricane storm surge modeling and small scale high fidelity models to evaluate the benefits of wetlands ecosystems to reduce storm surge and related damage to critical infrastructure quantified using geospatial analyses. Quantifying these benefits will provide sound scientific information to support planning and decision making. ",

                    "project_abstract": "One of the most difficult aspects of seismic hazard analysis is the prediction of ground motion from potential earthquakes. Accurate simulation of ground motion requires extensive knowledge of the velocity structure, source type, and site conditions in a given region; these factors must be paired with a high-resolution model mesh to predict ground motion at frequencies relevant to engineering and hazard applications. Limitations in model size and data availability often make it such that finer details in the earth model are averaged out or removed altogether, despite the fact that they could have a significant effect on predicted ground motion. In this project, we propose to examine the contribution to ground motion of an often-neglected site condition: topography. Topography has been observed to more than double earthquake ground motion in certain situations, though because of its azimuthal dependence and need for high-resolution model meshes, it is not considered in seismic hazard analysis. We will build a high-resolution mesh covering a 60km x 60km region centered on Seattle, Washington, and using the spectral element code SPECFEM3D Cartesian, run multiple rupture scenarios for Mw6.5-7.0 earthquakes on the Seattle Fault. By using high-resolution topography and a detailed 3-D velocity model, we will have an unprecedented view into the contribution of topography on seismic site response. With these tests, we will answer the question of how sensitive topographic effects are to source variability in finite fault rupture, like hypocenter location, slip distribution, and event magnitude. Paired with results from earlier tests with smaller earthquakes (Mw3.0-4.0), we will also investigate how topographic effects vary between small and large earthquakes, which have distinctly different frequency content, source distribution, and shaking duration. The results of this testing will amount to a major benchmark for the inclusion of high-resolution site conditions like topography in seismic hazard analysis.",

It can lead to significant flooding in coastal areas and severe damages to the life and property from a hurricane. Quantifying the risk to storm surge hazard often relies on large number of simulated hurricanes from storm surge modeling systems due to lack of sufficient historical data. The Advanced Circulation (ADCIRC) model is one of the primary storm surge models in the United States, and has been used to predict storm surge and control the impact of storm damage. A single simulation run from the ADCIRC model requires five hours, which is too expensive for risk management. Statistical surrogate models have been widely used to approximate outputs from computer models. Our research goal is to develop a statistical surrogate model to approximate the outputs from the ADCIRC model. The ADCIRC model generate more than 130,000 outputs for a single run. To build the statistical surrogate model, we plan to run about 10,000 simulation runs. We requresting a Startup account so that we can perform statistical analysis based on these massive simulation outputs. We mainly write R code to perform statistical analysis. The computation in training our statistical model is very computational expensive and requires lots of memories (about 100GB). In addition, the ADCIRC model outputs are also generated by our collaborator as an independent PI using computing resources at the TACC. Once I am approved, I can directly perform statistical analysis on these computer model simulations at TACC without moving the massive amount of data (about 10 TB) elsewhere.",
